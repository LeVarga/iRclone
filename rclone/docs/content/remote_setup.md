# Configuring rclone on a remote / headless machine #

Some of the configurations (those involving oauth2) require an
Internet connected web browser.

If you are trying to set rclone up on a remote or headless box with no
browser available on it (eg a NAS or a server in a datacenter) then
you will need to use an alternative means of configuration.  There are
two ways of doing it, described below.

## Configuring using rclone authorize ##

On the headless box

```
...
Remote config
Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> n
For this to work, you will need rclone available on a machine that has a web browser available.
Execute the following on your machine:
	rclone authorize "amazon cloud drive"
Then paste the result below:
result>
```

Then on your main desktop machine

```
rclone authorize "amazon cloud drive"
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
Paste the following into your remote machine --->
SECRET_TOKEN
<---End paste
```

Then back to the headless box, paste in the code

```
result> SECRET_TOKEN
--------------------
[acd12]
client_id = 
client_secret = 
token = SECRET_TOKEN
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d>
```

## Configuring by copying the config file ##

Rclone stores all of its config in a single configuration file.  This
can easily be copied to configure a remote rclone.

So first configure rclone on your desktop machine

    rclone config

to set up the config file.

Find the config file by running `rclone config file`, for example

```
$ rclone config file
Configuration file is stored at:
/home/user/.rclone.conf
```

Now transfer it to the remote box (scp, cut paste, ftp, sftp etc) and
place it in the correct place (use `rclone config file` on the remote
box to find out where).

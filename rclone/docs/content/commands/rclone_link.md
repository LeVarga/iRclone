## rclone link

Generate public link to file/folder.

rclone link will create or retrieve a public link to the given file or folder.

    rclone link remote:path/to/file
    rclone link remote:path/to/folder/

If successful, the last line of the output will contain the link. Exact
capabilities depend on the remote, but the link will always be created with
the least constraints â€“ e.g. no expiry, no password protection, accessible
without account.

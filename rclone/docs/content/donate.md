## <i class="fa fa-heart"></i> Flowers for My Wife ##

Rclone is a pure open source for love-not-money project.  However I've
had requests for a donation page and coding rclone does take me away
from something else I love - my wonderful wife.

So if you would like to send a donation, I will use it to buy flowers
(and other pretty things) for her which will make her very happy.

money if the donate button doesn't work for you (eg you live in
Japan), or if you prefer to use it.

If you would prefer to express your gratitude by promoting the
project, or helping with it, I'd be over the moon with that too!

Thanks

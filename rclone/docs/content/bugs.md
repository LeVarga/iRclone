# Bugs and Limitations

## Limitations

### Directory timestamps aren't preserved

Rclone doesn't currently preserve the timestamps of directories.  This
is because rclone only really considers objects when syncing.

### Rclone struggles with millions of files in a directory

Currently rclone loads each directory entirely into memory before
using it.  Since each Rclone object takes 0.5k-1k of memory this can
take a very long time and use an extremely large amount of memory.

Millions of files in a directory tend caused by software writing cloud
storage (eg S3 buckets).

### Bucket based remotes and folders

Bucket based remotes (eg S3/GCS/Swift/B2) do not have a concept of
directories.  Rclone therefore cannot create directories in them which
means that empty directories on a bucket based remote will tend to
disappear.

Some software creates empty keys ending in `/` as directory markers.
Rclone doesn't do this as it potentially creates more objects and
costs more.  It may do in future (probably with a flag).

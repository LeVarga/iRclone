INSTALL


Rclone is a Go program and comes as a single binary file.


Quickstart

-   Download the relevant binary.
-   Extract the rclone or rclone.exe binary from the archive
-   Run rclone config to setup. See rclone config docs for more details.

See below for some expanded Linux / macOS instructions.

See the Usage section of the docs for how to use rclone, or run
rclone -h.


Script installation

To install rclone on Linux/macOS/BSD systems, run:

    curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash

For beta installation, run:

    curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash -s beta

Note that this script checks the version of rclone installed first and
won’t re-download if not needed.


Linux installation from precompiled binary

Fetch and unpack

    curl -O https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
    unzip rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
    cd rclone-*-linux-amd64

Copy binary file

    sudo cp rclone /usr/bin/
    sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/rclone
    sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/rclone

Install manpage

    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/man/man1
    sudo cp rclone.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/
    sudo mandb 

Run rclone config to setup. See rclone config docs for more details.

    rclone config


macOS installation from precompiled binary

Download the latest version of rclone.

    cd && curl -O https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-osx-amd64.zip

Unzip the download and cd to the extracted folder.

    unzip -a rclone-current-osx-amd64.zip && cd rclone-*-osx-amd64

Move rclone to your $PATH. You will be prompted for your password.

    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
    sudo mv rclone /usr/local/bin/

(the mkdir command is safe to run, even if the directory already
exists).

Remove the leftover files.

    cd .. && rm -rf rclone-*-osx-amd64 rclone-current-osx-amd64.zip

Run rclone config to setup. See rclone config docs for more details.

    rclone config


Install with docker

The rclone maintains a docker image for rclone. These images are
autobuilt by docker hub from the rclone source based on a minimal Alpine
linux image.

The :latest tag will always point to the latest stable release. You can
use the :beta tag to get the latest build from master. You can also use
version tags, eg :1.49.1, :1.49 or :1.

    $ docker pull rclone/rclone:latest
    latest: Pulling from rclone/rclone
    Digest: sha256:0e0ced72671989bb837fea8e88578b3fc48371aa45d209663683e24cfdaa0e11
    ...
    $ docker run --rm rclone/rclone:latest version
    rclone v1.49.1
    - os/arch: linux/amd64
    - go version: go1.12.9

There are a few command line options to consider when starting an rclone
Docker container from the rclone image.

-   You need to mount the host rclone config dir at /config/rclone into
    the Docker container. Due to the fact that rclone updates tokens
    inside its config file, and that the update process involves a file
    rename, you need to mount the whole host rclone config dir, not just
    the single host rclone config file.

-   You need to mount a host data dir at /data into the Docker
    container.

-   By default, the rclone binary inside a Docker container runs with
    UID=0 (root). As a result, all files created in a run will have
    UID=0. If your config and data files reside on the host with a
    non-root UID:GID, you need to pass these on the container start
    command line.

-   It is possible to use rclone mount inside a userspace Docker
    container, and expose the resulting fuse mount to the host. The
    exact docker run options to do that might vary slightly between
    hosts. See, e.g. the discussion in this thread.

    You also need to mount the host /etc/passwd and /etc/group for fuse
    to work inside the container.

Here are some commands tested on an Ubuntu 18.04.3 host:

    # config on host at ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
    # data on host at ~/data

    # make sure the config is ok by listing the remotes
    docker run --rm \
        --volume ~/.config/rclone:/config/rclone \
        --volume ~/data:/data:shared \
        --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
        rclone/rclone \
        listremotes

    # perform mount inside Docker container, expose result to host
    mkdir -p ~/data/mount
    docker run --rm \
        --volume ~/.config/rclone:/config/rclone \
        --volume ~/data:/data:shared \
        --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
        --volume /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro --volume /etc/group:/etc/group:ro \
        --device /dev/fuse --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --security-opt apparmor:unconfined \
        rclone/rclone \
        mount dropbox:Photos /data/mount &
    ls ~/data/mount
    kill %1


Install from source

Make sure you have at least Go 1.7 installed. Download go if necessary.
The latest release is recommended. Then

    git clone https://github.com/rclone/rclone.git
    cd rclone
    go build
    ./rclone version

You can also build and install rclone in the GOPATH (which defaults to
~/go) with:

    go get -u -v github.com/rclone/rclone

and this will build the binary in $GOPATH/bin (~/go/bin/rclone by
default) after downloading the source to
$GOPATH/src/github.com/rclone/rclone (~/go/src/github.com/rclone/rclone
by default).


Installation with Ansible

This can be done with Stefan Weichinger’s ansible role.

Instructions

1.  git clone https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible-rclone.git
    into your local roles-directory
2.  add the role to the hosts you want rclone installed to:

        - hosts: rclone-hosts
          roles:
              - rclone


Configure

First, you’ll need to configure rclone. As the object storage systems
have quite complicated authentication these are kept in a config file.
(See the --config entry for how to find the config file and choose its
location.)

The easiest way to make the config is to run rclone with the config
option:

    rclone config

Usage

Rclone syncs a directory tree from one storage system to another.

Its syntax is like this

    Syntax: [options] subcommand <parameters> <parameters...>

Source and destination paths are specified by the name you gave the
storage system in the config file then the sub path, eg “drive:myfolder”
to look at “myfolder” in Google drive.

You can define as many storage paths as you like in the config file.


Subcommands

rclone uses a system of subcommands. For example

    rclone ls remote:path # lists a remote
    rclone copy /local/path remote:path # copies /local/path to the remote
    rclone sync /local/path remote:path # syncs /local/path to the remote


rclone config

rclone copy

Copy files from source to dest, skipping already copied

Synopsis

Copy the source to the destination. Doesn’t transfer unchanged files,
testing by size and modification time or MD5SUM. Doesn’t delete files
from the destination.

Note that it is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not
the directory so when source:path is a directory, it’s the contents of
source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents.

If dest:path doesn’t exist, it is created and the source:path contents
go there.

For example

    rclone copy source:sourcepath dest:destpath

Let’s say there are two files in sourcepath

    sourcepath/one.txt
    sourcepath/two.txt

This copies them to

    destpath/one.txt
    destpath/two.txt

Not to

    destpath/sourcepath/one.txt
    destpath/sourcepath/two.txt

If you are familiar with rsync, rclone always works as if you had
written a trailing / - meaning “copy the contents of this directory”.
This applies to all commands and whether you are talking about the
source or destination.

See the –no-traverse option for controlling whether rclone lists the
destination directory or not. Supplying this option when copying a small
number of files into a large destination can speed transfers up greatly.

For example, if you have many files in /path/to/src but only a few of
them change every day, you can to copy all the files which have changed
recently very efficiently like this:

    rclone copy --max-age 24h --no-traverse /path/to/src remote:

NOTE: Use the -P/--progress flag to view real-time transfer statistics

    rclone copy source:path dest:path [flags]

Options

          --create-empty-src-dirs   Create empty source dirs on destination after copy
      -h, --help                    help for copy

See the global flags page for global options not listed here.

SEE ALSO

rclone sync

Make source and dest identical, modifying destination only.

Synopsis

Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination only.
Doesn’t transfer unchanged files, testing by size and modification time
or MD5SUM. Destination is updated to match source, including deleting
files if necessary.

IMPORTANT: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the --dry-run
flag to see exactly what would be copied and deleted.

Note that files in the destination won’t be deleted if there were any
errors at any point.

It is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not the
directory so when source:path is a directory, it’s the contents of
source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents. See
extended explanation in the copy command above if unsure.

If dest:path doesn’t exist, it is created and the source:path contents
go there.

NOTE: Use the -P/--progress flag to view real-time transfer statistics

    rclone sync source:path dest:path [flags]

Options

          --create-empty-src-dirs   Create empty source dirs on destination after sync
      -h, --help                    help for sync

See the global flags page for global options not listed here.

SEE ALSO

rclone move

Move files from source to dest.

Synopsis

Moves the contents of the source directory to the destination directory.
Rclone will error if the source and destination overlap and the remote
does not support a server side directory move operation.

If no filters are in use and if possible this will server side move
source:path into dest:path. After this source:path will no longer longer
exist.

Otherwise for each file in source:path selected by the filters (if any)
this will move it into dest:path. If possible a server side move will be
used, otherwise it will copy it (server side if possible) into dest:path
then delete the original (if no errors on copy) in source:path.

If you want to delete empty source directories after move, use the
–delete-empty-src-dirs flag.

See the –no-traverse option for controlling whether rclone lists the
destination directory or not. Supplying this option when moving a small
number of files into a large destination can speed transfers up greatly.

IMPORTANT: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the –dry-run
flag.

NOTE: Use the -P/--progress flag to view real-time transfer statistics.

    rclone move source:path dest:path [flags]

Options

          --create-empty-src-dirs   Create empty source dirs on destination after move
          --delete-empty-src-dirs   Delete empty source dirs after move
      -h, --help                    help for move

See the global flags page for global options not listed here.

SEE ALSO

rclone delete

Remove the contents of path.

Synopsis

Remove the files in path. Unlike purge it obeys include/exclude filters
so can be used to selectively delete files.

rclone delete only deletes objects but leaves the directory structure
alone. If you want to delete a directory and all of its contents use
rclone purge

Eg delete all files bigger than 100MBytes

Check what would be deleted first (use either)

    rclone --min-size 100M lsl remote:path
    rclone --dry-run --min-size 100M delete remote:path

Then delete

    rclone --min-size 100M delete remote:path

That reads “delete everything with a minimum size of 100 MB”, hence
delete all files bigger than 100MBytes.

    rclone delete remote:path [flags]

Options

      -h, --help   help for delete

See the global flags page for global options not listed here.

SEE ALSO

-   rclone - Show help for rclone commands, flags and backends.


rclone purge

Remove the path and all of its contents.

Synopsis

Remove the path and all of its contents. Note that this does not obey
include/exclude filters - everything will be removed. Use delete if you
want to selectively delete files.

    rclone purge remote:path [flags]

Options

      -h, --help   help for purge

See the global flags page for global options not listed here.

SEE ALSO

-   rclone - Show help for rclone commands, flags and backends.


rclone mkdir

Make the path if it doesn’t already exist.

Synopsis

Make the path if it doesn’t already exist.

    rclone mkdir remote:path [flags]

Options

      -h, --help   help for mkdir

See the global flags page for global options not listed here.

SEE ALSO

-   rclone - Show help for rclone commands, flags and backends.


rclone rmdir

Remove the path if empty.

Synopsis

Remove the path. Note that you can’t remove a path with objects in it,
use purge for that.

    rclone rmdir remote:path [flags]

Options

      -h, --help   help for rmdir

See the global flags page for global options not listed here.

SEE ALSO

-   rclone - Show help for rclone commands, flags and backends.


rclone check

Checks the files in the source and destination match.

Synopsis

Checks the files in the source and destination match. It compares sizes
and hashes (MD5 or SHA1) and logs a report of files which don’t match.
It doesn’t alter the source or destination.

If you supply the –size-only flag, it will only compare the sizes not
the hashes as well. Use this for a quick check.

If you supply the –download flag, it will download the data from both
remotes and check them against each other on the fly. This can be useful
for remotes that don’t support hashes or if you really want to check all
the data.

If you supply the –one-way flag, it will only check that files in source
match the files in destination, not the other way around. Meaning extra
files in destination that are not in the source will not trigger an
error.

    rclone check source:path dest:path [flags]

Options

          --download   Check by downloading rather than with hash.
      -h, --help       help for check
          --one-way    Check one way only, source files must exist on remote

See the global flags page for global options not listed here.

SEE ALSO

-   rclone - Show help for rclone commands, flags and backends.


rclone ls

List the objects in the path with size and path.

Synopsis

Lists the objects in the source path to standard output in a human
readable format with size and path. Recurses by default.

Eg

    $ rclone ls swift:bucket
        60295 bevajer5jef
        90613 canole
        94467 diwogej7
        37600 fubuwic

Any of the filtering options can be applied to this command.

There are several related list commands

-   ls to list size and path of objects only
-   lsl to list modification time, size and path of objects only
-   lsd to list directories only
-   lsf to list objects and directories in easy to parse format
-   lsjson to list objects and directories in JSON format

ls,lsl,lsd are designed to be human readable. lsf is designed to be
human and machine readable. lsjson is designed to be machine readable.

Note that ls and lsl recurse by default - use “–max-depth 1” to stop the
recursion.

The other list commands lsd,lsf,lsjson do not recurse by default - use
“-R” to make them recurse.

Listing a non existent directory will produce an error except for
remotes which can’t have empty directories (eg s3, swift, gcs, etc - the
bucket based remotes).

    rclone ls remote:path [flags]

Options

      -h, --help   help for ls

See the global flags page for global options not listed here.

SEE ALSO

-   rclone - Show help for rclone commands, flags and backends.


rclone lsd

List all directories/containers/buckets in the path.

Synopsis

Lists the directories in the source path to standard output. Does not
recurse by default. Use the -R flag to recurse.

This command lists the total size of the directory (if known, -1 if
not), the modification time (if known, the current time if not), the
number of objects in the directory (if known, -1 if not) and the name of
the directory, Eg

    $ rclone lsd swift:
          494000 2018-04-26 08:43:20     10000 10000files
              65 2018-04-26 08:43:20         1 1File

Or

    $ rclone lsd drive:test
              -1 2016-10-17 17:41:53        -1 1000files
              -1 2017-01-03 14:40:54        -1 2500files
              -1 2017-07-08 14:39:28        -1 4000files

If you just want the directory names use “rclone lsf –dirs-only”.

rclone dedupe

Interactively find duplicate files and delete/rename them.

Synopsis

By default dedupe interactively finds duplicate files and offers to
delete all but one or rename them to be different. Only useful with
Google Drive which can have duplicate file names.

In the first pass it will merge directories with the same name. It will
do this iteratively until all the identical directories have been
merged.

The dedupe command will delete all but one of any identical (same
md5sum) files it finds without confirmation. This means that for most
duplicated files the dedupe command will not be interactive. You can use
--dry-run to see what would happen without doing anything.

Here is an example run.

Before - with duplicates

    $ rclone lsl drive:dupes
      6048320 2016-03-05 16:23:16.798000000 one.txt

Dedupe can be run non interactively using the --dedupe-mode flag or by
using an extra parameter with the same value

-   --dedupe-mode interactive - interactive as above.
-   --dedupe-mode skip - removes identical files then skips anything
    left.
-   --dedupe-mode first - removes identical files then keeps the first
    one.
-   --dedupe-mode newest - removes identical files then keeps the newest
    one.
-   --dedupe-mode oldest - removes identical files then keeps the oldest
    one.
-   --dedupe-mode largest - removes identical files then keeps the
    largest one.
-   --dedupe-mode rename - removes identical files then renames the rest
    to be different.

For example to rename all the identically named photos in your Google
Photos directory, do

    rclone dedupe --dedupe-mode rename "drive:Google Photos"

Or

    rclone dedupe rename "drive:Google Photos"

    rclone dedupe [mode] remote:path [flags]

Options

          --dedupe-mode string   Dedupe mode interactive|skip|first|newest|oldest|rename. (default "interactive")

rclone copyto

Copy files from source to dest, skipping already copied

Synopsis

If source:path is a file or directory then it copies it to a file or
directory named dest:path.

This can be used to upload single files to other than their current
name. If the source is a directory then it acts exactly like the copy
command.

So

    rclone copyto src dst

where src and dst are rclone paths, either remote:path or /path/to/local
or C:.

This will:

    if src is file
        copy it to dst, overwriting an existing file if it exists
    if src is directory
        copy it to dst, overwriting existing files if they exist
        see copy command for full details

This doesn’t transfer unchanged files, testing by size and modification
time or MD5SUM. It doesn’t delete files from the destination.

NOTE: Use the -P/--progress flag to view real-time transfer statistics

    rclone copyto source:path dest:path [flags]

Options

      -h, --help   help for copyto

rclone cryptcheck

Cryptcheck checks the integrity of a crypted remote.

Synopsis

rclone cryptcheck checks a remote against a crypted remote. This is the
equivalent of running rclone check, but able to check the checksums of
the crypted remote.

For it to work the underlying remote of the cryptedremote must support
some kind of checksum.

It works by reading the nonce from each file on the cryptedremote: and
using that to encrypt each file on the remote:. It then checks the
checksum of the underlying file on the cryptedremote: against the
checksum of the file it has just encrypted.

Use it like this

    rclone cryptcheck /path/to/files encryptedremote:path

You can use it like this also, but that will involve downloading all the
files in remote:path.

    rclone cryptcheck remote:path encryptedremote:path

After it has run it will log the status of the encryptedremote:.

If you supply the –one-way flag, it will only check that files in source
match the files in destination, not the other way around. Meaning extra
files in destination that are not in the source will not trigger an
error.

    rclone cryptcheck remote:path cryptedremote:path [flags]

Options

      -h, --help      help for cryptcheck
          --one-way   Check one way only, source files must exist on destination

use it like this

    rclone cryptdecode encryptedremote: encryptedfilename1 encryptedfilename2

    rclone cryptdecode --reverse encryptedremote: filename1 filename2

    rclone cryptdecode encryptedremote: encryptedfilename [flags]

Use the –format option to control what gets listed. By default this is
just the path, but you can use these parameters to control the output:

    p - path
    s - size
    t - modification time
    h - hash
    i - ID of object
    o - Original ID of underlying object
    m - MimeType of object if known
    e - encrypted name
    T - tier of storage if known, eg "Hot" or "Cool"

So if you wanted the path, size and modification time, you would use
–format “pst”, or maybe –format “tsp” to put the path last.

Eg

    $ rclone lsf  --format "tsp" swift:bucket
    2016-06-25 18:55:41;60295;bevajer5jef
    2016-06-25 18:55:43;90613;canole

    2016-06-25 18:55:40;37600;fubuwic

If you specify “h” in the format you will get the MD5 hash by default,
use the “–hash” flag to change which hash you want. Note that this can
be returned as an empty string if it isn’t available on the object (and
for directories), “ERROR” if there was an error reading it from the
object and “UNSUPPORTED” if that object does not support that hash type.

For example to emulate the md5sum command you can use

    rclone lsf -R --hash MD5 --format hp --separator "  " --files-only .

Eg

    $ rclone lsf -R --hash MD5 --format hp --separator "  " --files-only swift:bucket

(Though “rclone md5sum .” is an easier way of typing this.)

By default the separator is “;” this can be changed with the –separator
flag. Note that separators aren’t escaped in the path so putting it last
is a good strategy.

Eg

    $ rclone lsf  --separator "," --format "tshp" swift:bucket
    2016-06-25 18:55:41,60295,7908e352297f0f530b84a756f188baa3,bevajer5jef

You can output in CSV standard format. This will escape things in " if
they contain ,

Eg

    $ rclone lsf --csv --files-only --format ps remote:path
    test.log,22355
    test.sh,449
    "this file contains a comma, in the file name.txt",6

Note that the –absolute parameter is useful for making lists of files to
pass to an rclone copy with the –files-from flag.

For example to find all the files modified within one day and copy those
only (without traversing the whole directory structure):

    rclone lsf --absolute --files-only --max-age 1d /path/to/local > new_files
    rclone copy --files-from new_files /path/to/local remote:path

Any of the filtering options can be applied to this command.

There are several related list commands

-   ls to list size and path of objects only
-   lsl to list modification time, size and path of objects only
-   lsd to list directories only
-   lsf to list objects and directories in easy to parse format
-   lsjson to list objects and directories in JSON format

ls,lsl,lsd are designed to be human readable. lsf is designed to be
human and machine readable. lsjson is designed to be machine readable.

Note that ls and lsl recurse by default - use “–max-depth 1” to stop the
recursion.

The other list commands lsd,lsf,lsjson do not recurse by default - use
“-R” to make them recurse.

Listing a non existent directory will produce an error except for
remotes which can’t have empty directories (eg s3, swift, gcs, etc - the
bucket based remotes).

    rclone lsf remote:path [flags]

rclone lsjson

List directories and objects in the path in JSON format.

Synopsis

List directories and objects in the path in JSON format.

The output is an array of Items, where each Item looks like this

{ “Hashes” : { “SHA-1” : “f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f”,
“MD5” : “b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184”, “DropboxHash” :
“ecb65bb98f9d905b70458986c39fcbad7715e5f2fcc3b1f07767d7c83e2438cc” },
“ID”: “y2djkhiujf83u33”, “OrigID”: “UYOJVTUW00Q1RzTDA”, “IsBucket” :
false, “IsDir” : false, “MimeType” : “application/octet-stream”,
“ModTime” : “2017-05-31T16:15:57.034468261+01:00”, “Name” : “file.txt”,
“Encrypted” : “v0qpsdq8anpci8n929v3uu9338”, “EncryptedPath” :
“kja9098349023498/v0qpsdq8anpci8n929v3uu9338”, “Path” :
“full/path/goes/here/file.txt”, “Size” : 6, “Tier” : “hot”, }

If –hash is not specified the Hashes property won’t be emitted.

If –no-modtime is specified then ModTime will be blank.

If –encrypted is not specified the Encrypted won’t be emitted.

If –dirs-only is not specified files in addition to directories are
returned

If –files-only is not specified directories in addition to the files
will be returned.

The Path field will only show folders below the remote path being
listed. If “remote:path” contains the file “subfolder/file.txt”, the
Path for “file.txt” will be “subfolder/file.txt”, not
“remote:path/subfolder/file.txt”. When used without –recursive the Path
will always be the same as Name.

If the directory is a bucket in a bucket based backend, then “IsBucket”
will be set to true. This key won’t be present unless it is “true”.

The time is in RFC3339 format with up to nanosecond precision. The
number of decimal digits in the seconds will depend on the precision
that the remote can hold the times, so if times are accurate to the
nearest millisecond (eg Google Drive) then 3 digits will always be shown
(“2017-05-31T16:15:57.034+01:00”) whereas if the times are accurate to
the nearest second (Dropbox, Box, WebDav etc) no digits will be shown
(“2017-05-31T16:15:57+01:00”).

The whole output can be processed as a JSON blob, or alternatively it
can be processed line by line as each item is written one to a line.

Any of the filtering options can be applied to this command.

There are several related list commands

-   ls to list size and path of objects only
-   lsl to list modification time, size and path of objects only

rclone mount

Mount the remote as file system on a mountpoint.

Synopsis

rclone mount allows Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows to mount any of
Rclone’s cloud storage systems as a file system with FUSE.

First set up your remote using rclone config. Check it works with
rclone ls etc.

Start the mount like this

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files /path/to/local/mount

Or on Windows like this where X: is an unused drive letter

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X:

When the program ends, either via Ctrl+C or receiving a SIGINT or
SIGTERM signal, the mount is automatically stopped.

The umount operation can fail, for example when the mountpoint is busy.
When that happens, it is the user’s responsibility to stop the mount
manually with

    # Linux
    fusermount -u /path/to/local/mount
    # OS X
    umount /path/to/local/mount

Installing on Windows

To run rclone mount on Windows, you will need to download and install
WinFsp.

WinFsp is an open source Windows File System Proxy which makes it easy
to write user space file systems for Windows. It provides a FUSE
emulation layer which rclone uses combination with cgofuse. Both of
these packages are by Bill Zissimopoulos who was very helpful during the
implementation of rclone mount for Windows.

Windows caveats

Note that drives created as Administrator are not visible by other
accounts (including the account that was elevated as Administrator). So
if you start a Windows drive from an Administrative Command Prompt and
then try to access the same drive from Explorer (which does not run as
Administrator), you will not be able to see the new drive.

The easiest way around this is to start the drive from a normal command
prompt. It is also possible to start a drive from the SYSTEM account
(using the WinFsp.Launcher infrastructure) which creates drives
accessible for everyone on the system or alternatively using the nssm
service manager.

Limitations

Without the use of “–vfs-cache-mode” this can only write files
sequentially, it can only seek when reading. This means that many
applications won’t work with their files on an rclone mount without
“–vfs-cache-mode writes” or “–vfs-cache-mode full”. See the File Caching
section for more info.

The bucket based remotes (eg Swift, S3, Google Compute Storage, B2,
Hubic) do not support the concept of empty directories, so empty
directories will have a tendency to disappear once they fall out of the
directory cache.

Only supported on Linux, FreeBSD, OS X and Windows at the moment.

rclone mount vs rclone sync/copy

File systems expect things to be 100% reliable, whereas cloud storage
systems are a long way from 100% reliable. The rclone sync/copy commands
cope with this with lots of retries. However rclone mount can’t use
retries in the same way without making local copies of the uploads. Look
at the file caching for solutions to make mount more reliable.

Attribute caching

You can use the flag –attr-timeout to set the time the kernel caches the
attributes (size, modification time etc) for directory entries.

The default is “1s” which caches files just long enough to avoid too
many callbacks to rclone from the kernel.

In theory 0s should be the correct value for filesystems which can
change outside the control of the kernel. However this causes quite a
few problems such as rclone using too much memory, rclone not serving
files to samba and excessive time listing directories.

The kernel can cache the info about a file for the time given by
“–attr-timeout”. You may see corruption if the remote file changes
length during this window. It will show up as either a truncated file or
a file with garbage on the end. With “–attr-timeout 1s” this is very
unlikely but not impossible. The higher you set “–attr-timeout” the more
likely it is. The default setting of “1s” is the lowest setting which
mitigates the problems above.

If you set it higher (‘10s’ or ‘1m’ say) then the kernel will call back
to rclone less often making it more efficient, however there is more
chance of the corruption issue above.

If files don’t change on the remote outside of the control of rclone
then there is no chance of corruption.

This is the same as setting the attr_timeout option in mount.fuse.

Filters

Note that all the rclone filters can be used to select a subset of the
files to be visible in the mount.

systemd

When running rclone mount as a systemd service, it is possible to use
Type=notify. In this case the service will enter the started state after
the mountpoint has been successfully set up. Units having the rclone
mount service specified as a requirement will see all files and folders
immediately in this mode.

chunked reading

–vfs-read-chunk-size will enable reading the source objects in parts.
This can reduce the used download quota for some remotes by requesting
only chunks from the remote that are actually read at the cost of an
increased number of requests.

When –vfs-read-chunk-size-limit is also specified and greater than
–vfs-read-chunk-size, the chunk size for each open file will get doubled
for each chunk read, until the specified value is reached. A value of -1
will disable the limit and the chunk size will grow indefinitely.

With –vfs-read-chunk-size 100M and –vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0 the
following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M,
300M-400M and so on. When –vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M is specified,
the result would be 0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M,
1200M-1700M and so on.

Chunked reading will only work with –vfs-cache-mode < full, as the file
will always be copied to the vfs cache before opening with
–vfs-cache-mode full.

Directory Cache

Using the --dir-cache-time flag, you can set how long a directory should
be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend. Changes
made locally in the mount may appear immediately or invalidate the
cache. However, changes done on the remote will only be picked up once
the cache expires.

Alternatively, you can send a SIGHUP signal to rclone for it to flush
all directory caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

File Buffering

The --buffer-size flag determines the amount of memory, that will be
used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file descriptor will try to keep the specified amount of data
in memory at all times. The buffered data is bound to one file
descriptor and won’t be shared between multiple open file descriptors of
the same file.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per file descriptor. The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet
read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be
used. The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
--buffer-size * open files.

File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. The VFS layer is used
by rclone mount to make a cloud storage system work more like a normal
file system.

You’ll need to enable VFS caching if you want, for example, to read and
write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache works in addition to the cache backend and you
may find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache. (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-mode string              Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default "off")
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects. (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size int             Max total size of objects in the cache. (default off)

If run with -vv rclone will print the location of the file cache. The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with --cache-dir or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by --vfs-cache-mode. The higher
the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using
disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
so if rclone is quit or dies with open files then these won’t get
written back to the remote. However they will still be in the on disk
cache.

If using –vfs-cache-max-size note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every
–vfs-cache-poll-interval. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted
from the cache.

–vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

-   Files can’t be opened for both read AND write
-   Files opened for write can’t be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
-   Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
-   Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
-   If an upload fails it can’t be retried

–vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to “off” except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disks. This means that files opened for write
will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

-   Files opened for write only can’t be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
-   If an upload fails it can’t be retried

–vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried up to –low-level-retries times.

–vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When a
file is opened for read it will be downloaded in its entirety first.

This may be appropriate for your needs, or you may prefer to look at the
cache backend which does a much more sophisticated job of caching,
including caching directory hierarchies and chunks of files.

In this mode, unlike the others, when a file is written to the disk, it
will be kept on the disk after it is written to the remote. It will be
purged on a schedule according to --vfs-cache-max-age.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload or download fails it will be retried up to
–low-level-retries times.

rclone moveto

Move file or directory from source to dest.

Synopsis

If source:path is a file or directory then it moves it to a file or
directory named dest:path.

This can be used to rename files or upload single files to other than
their existing name. If the source is a directory then it acts exactly
like the move command.

So

    rclone moveto src dst

where src and dst are rclone paths, either remote:path or /path/to/local
or C:.

This will:

    if src is file
        move it to dst, overwriting an existing file if it exists
    if src is directory
        move it to dst, overwriting existing files if they exist
        see move command for full details

This doesn’t transfer unchanged files, testing by size and modification
time or MD5SUM. src will be deleted on successful transfer.

IMPORTANT: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the –dry-run
flag.

NOTE: Use the -P/--progress flag to view real-time transfer statistics.

rclone ncdu

Explore a remote with a text based user interface.

Synopsis

This displays a text based user interface allowing the navigation of a
remote. It is most useful for answering the question - “What is using
all my disk space?”.

To make the user interface it first scans the entire remote given and
builds an in memory representation. rclone ncdu can be used during this
scanning phase and you will see it building up the directory structure
as it goes along.

Here are the keys - press ‘?’ to toggle the help on and off

     ↑,↓ or k,j to Move
     →,l to enter
     ←,h to return
     c toggle counts
     g toggle graph
     n,s,C sort by name,size,count
     d delete file/directory
     Y display current path
     ^L refresh screen
     ? to toggle help on and off
     q/ESC/c-C to quit

This an homage to the ncdu tool but for rclone remotes. It is missing
lots of features at the moment but is useful as it stands.

Note that it might take some time to delete big files/folders. The UI
won’t respond in the meantime since the deletion is done synchronously.

rclone rc

Run a command against a running rclone.

Synopsis

This runs a command against a running rclone. Use the –url flag to
specify an non default URL to connect on. This can be either a “:port”
which is taken to mean “http://localhost:port” or a “host:port” which is
taken to mean “http://host:port”

A username and password can be passed in with –user and –pass.

Note that –rc-addr, –rc-user, –rc-pass will be read also for –url,
–user, –pass.

Arguments should be passed in as parameter=value.

The result will be returned as a JSON object by default.

The –json parameter can be used to pass in a JSON blob as an input
instead of key=value arguments. This is the only way of passing in more
complicated values.

Use –loopback to connect to the rclone instance running “rclone rc”.
This is very useful for testing commands without having to run an rclone
rc server, eg:

    rclone rc --loopback operations/about fs=/

Use “rclone rc” to see a list of all possible commands.

    rclone rc commands parameter [flags]

Options

      -h, --help          help for rc
          --json string   Input JSON - use instead of key=value args.
          --loopback      If set connect to this rclone instance not via HTTP.
          --no-output     If set don't output the JSON result.
          --pass string   Password to use to connect to rclone remote control.
          --url string    URL to connect to rclone remote control. (default "http://localhost:5572/")
          --user string   Username to use to rclone remote control.

rclone rcat

Copies standard input to file on remote.

Synopsis

rclone rcat reads from standard input (stdin) and copies it to a single
remote file.

    echo "hello world" | rclone rcat remote:path/to/file
    ffmpeg - | rclone rcat remote:path/to/file

If the remote file already exists, it will be overwritten.

rcat will try to upload small files in a single request, which is
usually more efficient than the streaming/chunked upload endpoints,
which use multiple requests. Exact behaviour depends on the remote. What
is considered a small file may be set through --streaming-upload-cutoff.
Uploading only starts after the cutoff is reached or if the file ends
before that. The data must fit into RAM. The cutoff needs to be small
enough to adhere the limits of your remote, please see there. Generally
speaking, setting this cutoff too high will decrease your performance.

Note that the upload can also not be retried because the data is not
kept around until the upload succeeds. If you need to transfer a lot of
data, you’re better off caching locally and then rclone move it to the
destination.

rclone rcd

Run rclone listening to remote control commands only.

Synopsis

This runs rclone so that it only listens to remote control commands.

This is useful if you are controlling rclone via the rc API.

If you pass in a path to a directory, rclone will serve that directory
for GET requests on the URL passed in. It will also open the URL in the
browser when rclone is run.

See the rc documentation for more info on the rc flags.

rclone rmdirs

Remove empty directories under the path.

Synopsis

This removes any empty directories (or directories that only contain
empty directories) under the path that it finds, including the path if
it has nothing in.

If you supply the –leave-root flag, it will not remove the root
directory.

This is useful for tidying up remotes that rclone has left a lot of
empty directories in.

    rclone rmdirs remote:path [flags]

Options

      -h, --help         help for rmdirs

rclone serve

Serve a remote over a protocol.

Synopsis

rclone serve is used to serve a remote over a given protocol. This
command requires the use of a subcommand to specify the protocol, eg

    rclone serve http remote:

Each subcommand has its own options which you can see in their help.

rclone serve dlna

Serve remote:path over DLNA

Synopsis

rclone serve dlna is a DLNA media server for media stored in a rclone
remote. Many devices, such as the Xbox and PlayStation, can
automatically discover this server in the LAN and play audio/video from
it. VLC is also supported. Service discovery uses UDP multicast packets
(SSDP) and will thus only work on LANs.

Rclone will list all files present in the remote, without filtering
based on media formats or file extensions. Additionally, there is no
media transcoding support. This means that some players might show files
that they are not able to play back correctly.

Server options

Use –addr to specify which IP address and port the server should listen
on, eg –addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or –addr :8080 to listen to all IPs.

Use –name to choose the friendly server name, which is by default
“rclone (hostname)”.

Use –log-trace in conjunction with -vv to enable additional debug
logging of all UPNP traffic.

Directory Cache

Using the --dir-cache-time flag, you can set how long a directory should
be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend. Changes
made locally in the mount may appear immediately or invalidate the
cache. However, changes done on the remote will only be picked up once
the cache expires.

Alternatively, you can send a SIGHUP signal to rclone for it to flush
all directory caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

File Buffering

The --buffer-size flag determines the amount of memory, that will be
used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file descriptor will try to keep the specified amount of data
in memory at all times. The buffered data is bound to one file
descriptor and won’t be shared between multiple open file descriptors of
the same file.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per file descriptor. The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet
read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be
used. The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
--buffer-size * open files.

File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. The VFS layer is used
by rclone mount to make a cloud storage system work more like a normal
file system.

You’ll need to enable VFS caching if you want, for example, to read and
write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache works in addition to the cache backend and you
may find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache. (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-mode string              Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default "off")
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects. (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size int             Max total size of objects in the cache. (default off)

If run with -vv rclone will print the location of the file cache. The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with --cache-dir or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by --vfs-cache-mode. The higher
the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using
disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
so if rclone is quit or dies with open files then these won’t get
written back to the remote. However they will still be in the on disk
cache.

If using –vfs-cache-max-size note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every
–vfs-cache-poll-interval. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted
from the cache.

–vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

-   Files can’t be opened for both read AND write
-   Files opened for write can’t be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
-   Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
-   Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
-   If an upload fails it can’t be retried

–vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to “off” except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disks. This means that files opened for write
will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

-   Files opened for write only can’t be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
-   If an upload fails it can’t be retried

–vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried up to –low-level-retries times.

–vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When a
file is opened for read it will be downloaded in its entirety first.

This may be appropriate for your needs, or you may prefer to look at the
cache backend which does a much more sophisticated job of caching,
including caching directory hierarchies and chunks of files.

In this mode, unlike the others, when a file is written to the disk, it
will be kept on the disk after it is written to the remote. It will be
purged on a schedule according to --vfs-cache-max-age.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload or download fails it will be retried up to
–low-level-retries times.

rclone serve ftp

Serve remote:path over FTP.

Synopsis

rclone serve ftp implements a basic ftp server to serve the remote over
FTP protocol. This can be viewed with a ftp client or you can make a
remote of type ftp to read and write it.

Server options

Use –addr to specify which IP address and port the server should listen
on, eg –addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or –addr :8080 to listen to all IPs. By
default it only listens on localhost. You can use port :0 to let the OS
choose an available port.

If you set –addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address then
using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can set a single username and password with the –user and –pass
flags.

Directory Cache

Using the --dir-cache-time flag, you can set how long a directory should
be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend. Changes
made locally in the mount may appear immediately or invalidate the
cache. However, changes done on the remote will only be picked up once

Auth Proxy

If you supply the parameter --auth-proxy /path/to/program then rclone
will use that program to generate backends on the fly which then are
used to authenticate incoming requests. This uses a simple JSON based
protocl with input on STDIN and output on STDOUT.

There is an example program bin/test_proxy.py in the rclone source code.

The program’s job is to take a user and pass on the input and turn those
into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON format. This config will
have any default parameters for the backend added, but it won’t use
configuration from environment variables or command line options - it is
the job of the proxy program to make a complete config.

This config generated must have this extra parameter - _root - root to
use for the backend

And it may have this parameter - _obscure - comma separated strings for
parameters to obscure

For example the program might take this on STDIN

    {
        "user": "me",
        "pass": "mypassword"
    }

And return this on STDOUT

    {
        "type": "sftp",
        "_root": "",
        "_obscure": "pass",
        "user": "me",
        "pass": "mypassword",
        "host": "sftp.example.com"
    }

This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the
user and pass returned in the output to the host given. Note that since
_obscure is set to pass, rclone will obscure the pass parameter before
creating the backend (which is required for sftp backends).

The progam can manipulate the supplied user in any way, for example to
make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make the user be
user@example.com and then set the host to example.com in the output and
the user to user. For security you’d probably want to restrict the host
to a limited list.

Note that an internal cache is keyed on user so only use that for
configuration, don’t use pass. This also means that if a user’s password
is changed the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins) before it
takes effect.

This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend
that rclone supports.

rclone serve http

Serve the remote over HTTP.

Synopsis

rclone serve http implements a basic web server to serve the remote over
HTTP. This can be viewed in a web browser or you can make a remote of
type http read from it.

You can use the filter flags (eg –include, –exclude) to control what is
served.

The server will log errors. Use -v to see access logs.

–bwlimit will be respected for file transfers. Use –stats to control the
stats printing.

Server options

Use –addr to specify which IP address and port the server should listen
on, eg –addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or –addr :8080 to listen to all IPs. By
default it only listens on localhost. You can use port :0 to let the OS
choose an available port.

If you set –addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address then
using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

–server-read-timeout and –server-write-timeout can be used to control
the timeouts on the server. Note that this is the total time for a
transfer.

–max-header-bytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server will
accept in the HTTP header.

–baseurl controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from. By default
rclone will serve from the root. If you used –baseurl “/rclone” then
rclone would serve from a URL starting with “/rclone/”. This is useful
if you wish to proxy rclone serve. Rclone automatically inserts leading
and trailing “/” on –baseurl, so –baseurl “rclone”, –baseurl “/rclone”
and –baseurl “/rclone/” are all treated identically.

Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set
a single username and password with the –user and –pass flags.

Use –htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd to provide an htpasswd file. This is in
standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic
authentication. Bcrypt is recommended.

To create an htpasswd file:

    touch htpasswd
    htpasswd -B htpasswd user
    htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser

The password file can be updated while rclone is running.

Use –realm to set the authentication realm.

SSL/TLS

By default this will serve over http. If you want you can serve over
https. You will need to supply the –cert and –key flags. If you wish to
do client side certificate validation then you will need to supply
–client-ca also.

–cert should be a either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation of
that with the CA certificate. –key should be the PEM encoded private key
and –client-ca should be the PEM encoded client certificate authority
certificate.

Directory Cache

Using the --dir-cache-time flag, you can set how long a directory should
be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend. Changes
made locally in the mount may appear immediately or invalidate the
cache. However, changes done on the remote will only be picked up once
the cache expires.

Alternatively, you can send a SIGHUP signal to rclone for it to flush
all directory caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

File Buffering

The --buffer-size flag determines the amount of memory, that will be
used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file descriptor will try to keep the specified amount of data
in memory at all times. The buffered data is bound to one file
descriptor and won’t be shared between multiple open file descriptors of
the same file.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per file descriptor. The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet
read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be
used. The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
--buffer-size * open files.

File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. The VFS layer is used
by rclone mount to make a cloud storage system work more like a normal
file system.

You’ll need to enable VFS caching if you want, for example, to read and
write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache works in addition to the cache backend and you
may find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache. (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-mode string              Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default "off")
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects. (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size int             Max total size of objects in the cache. (default off)

If run with -vv rclone will print the location of the file cache. The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with --cache-dir or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by --vfs-cache-mode. The higher
the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using
disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
so if rclone is quit or dies with open files then these won’t get
written back to the remote. However they will still be in the on disk
cache.

If using –vfs-cache-max-size note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every
–vfs-cache-poll-interval. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted
from the cache.

–vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

-   Files can’t be opened for both read AND write
-   Files opened for write can’t be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
-   Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
-   Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
-   If an upload fails it can’t be retried

–vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to “off” except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disks. This means that files opened for write
will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

-   Files opened for write only can’t be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
-   If an upload fails it can’t be retried

–vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried up to –low-level-retries times.

–vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When a
file is opened for read it will be downloaded in its entirety first.

This may be appropriate for your needs, or you may prefer to look at the
cache backend which does a much more sophisticated job of caching,
including caching directory hierarchies and chunks of files.

In this mode, unlike the others, when a file is written to the disk, it
will be kept on the disk after it is written to the remote. It will be
purged on a schedule according to --vfs-cache-max-age.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload or download fails it will be retried up to
–low-level-retries times.

rclone serve restic

Serve the remote for restic’s REST API.

Synopsis

rclone serve restic implements restic’s REST backend API over HTTP. This
allows restic to use rclone as a data storage mechanism for cloud
providers that restic does not support directly.

Restic is a command line program for doing backups.

The server will log errors. Use -v to see access logs.

–bwlimit will be respected for file transfers. Use –stats to control the
stats printing.

Setting up rclone for use by restic

First set up a remote for your chosen cloud provider.

Once you have set up the remote, check it is working with, for example
“rclone lsd remote:”. You may have called the remote something other
than “remote:” - just substitute whatever you called it in the following
instructions.

Now start the rclone restic server

    rclone serve restic -v remote:backup

Where you can replace “backup” in the above by whatever path in the
remote you wish to use.

By default this will serve on “localhost:8080” you can change this with
use of the “–addr” flag.

You might wish to start this server on boot.

Setting up restic to use rclone

Now you can follow the restic instructions on setting up restic.

Note that you will need restic 0.8.2 or later to interoperate with
rclone.

For the example above you will want to use “http://localhost:8080/” as
the URL for the REST server.

For example:

    $ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/
    $ export RESTIC_PASSWORD=yourpassword
    $ restic init
    created restic backend 8b1a4b56ae at rest:http://localhost:8080/

    Please note that knowledge of your password is required to access
    the repository. Losing your password means that your data is
    irrecoverably lost.
    $ restic backup /path/to/files/to/backup
    scan [/path/to/files/to/backup]
    scanned 189 directories, 312 files in 0:00
    [0:00] 100.00%  38.128 MiB / 38.128 MiB  501 / 501 items  0 errors  ETA 0:00
    duration: 0:00
    snapshot 45c8fdd8 saved

Multiple repositories

Note that you can use the endpoint to host multiple repositories. Do
this by adding a directory name or path after the URL. Note that these
MUST end with /. Eg

    $ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user1repo/
    # backup user1 stuff
    $ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user2repo/
    # backup user2 stuff

Private repositories

The “–private-repos” flag can be used to limit users to repositories
starting with a path of “//”.

Server options

Use –addr to specify which IP address and port the server should listen
on, eg –addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or –addr :8080 to listen to all IPs. By
default it only listens on localhost. You can use port :0 to let the OS
choose an available port.

If you set –addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address then
using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

–server-read-timeout and –server-write-timeout can be used to control
the timeouts on the server. Note that this is the total time for a
transfer.

–max-header-bytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server will
accept in the HTTP header.

–baseurl controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from. By default
rclone will serve from the root. If you used –baseurl “/rclone” then
rclone would serve from a URL starting with “/rclone/”. This is useful
if you wish to proxy rclone serve. Rclone automatically inserts leading
and trailing “/” on –baseurl, so –baseurl “rclone”, –baseurl “/rclone”
and –baseurl “/rclone/” are all treated identically.

Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set
a single username and password with the –user and –pass flags.

Use –htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd to provide an htpasswd file. This is in
standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic
authentication. Bcrypt is recommended.

To create an htpasswd file:

    touch htpasswd
    htpasswd -B htpasswd user
    htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser

The password file can be updated while rclone is running.

Use –realm to set the authentication realm.

SSL/TLS

By default this will serve over http. If you want you can serve over
https. You will need to supply the –cert and –key flags. If you wish to
do client side certificate validation then you will need to supply
–client-ca also.

–cert should be a either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation of
that with the CA certificate. –key should be the PEM encoded private key
and –client-ca should be the PEM encoded client certificate authority
certificate.

rclone serve sftp

Serve the remote over SFTP.

Synopsis

rclone serve sftp implements an SFTP server to serve the remote over
SFTP. This can be used with an SFTP client or you can make a remote of
type sftp to use with it.

You can use the filter flags (eg –include, –exclude) to control what is
served.

The server will log errors. Use -v to see access logs.

–bwlimit will be respected for file transfers. Use –stats to control the
stats printing.

You must provide some means of authentication, either with –user/–pass,
an authorized keys file (specify location with –authorized-keys - the
default is the same as ssh) or set the –no-auth flag for no
authentication when logging in.

Note that this also implements a small number of shell commands so that
it can provide md5sum/sha1sum/df information for the rclone sftp
backend. This means that is can support SHA1SUMs, MD5SUMs and the about
command when paired with the rclone sftp backend.

If you don’t supply a –key then rclone will generate one and cache it
for later use.

By default the server binds to localhost:2022 - if you want it to be
reachable externally then supply “–addr :2022” for example.

Note that the default of “–vfs-cache-mode off” is fine for the rclone
sftp backend, but it may not be with other SFTP clients.

Directory Cache

Using the --dir-cache-time flag, you can set how long a directory should
be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend. Changes
made locally in the mount may appear immediately or invalidate the
cache. However, changes done on the remote will only be picked up once
the cache expires.

Alternatively, you can send a SIGHUP signal to rclone for it to flush
all directory caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

File Buffering

The --buffer-size flag determines the amount of memory, that will be
used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file descriptor will try to keep the specified amount of data
in memory at all times. The buffered data is bound to one file
descriptor and won’t be shared between multiple open file descriptors of
the same file.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per file descriptor. The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet
read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be
used. The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
--buffer-size * open files.

File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. The VFS layer is used
by rclone mount to make a cloud storage system work more like a normal
file system.

You’ll need to enable VFS caching if you want, for example, to read and
write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache works in addition to the cache backend and you
may find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache. (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-mode string              Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default "off")
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects. (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size int             Max total size of objects in the cache. (default off)

If run with -vv rclone will print the location of the file cache. The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with --cache-dir or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by --vfs-cache-mode. The higher
the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using
disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
so if rclone is quit or dies with open files then these won’t get
written back to the remote. However they will still be in the on disk
cache.

If using –vfs-cache-max-size note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every
–vfs-cache-poll-interval. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted
from the cache.

–vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

-   Files can’t be opened for both read AND write
-   Files opened for write can’t be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
-   Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
-   Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
-   If an upload fails it can’t be retried

–vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to “off” except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disks. This means that files opened for write
will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

-   Files opened for write only can’t be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
-   If an upload fails it can’t be retried

–vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried up to –low-level-retries times.

–vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When a
file is opened for read it will be downloaded in its entirety first.

This may be appropriate for your needs, or you may prefer to look at the
cache backend which does a much more sophisticated job of caching,
including caching directory hierarchies and chunks of files.

In this mode, unlike the others, when a file is written to the disk, it
will be kept on the disk after it is written to the remote. It will be
purged on a schedule according to --vfs-cache-max-age.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload or download fails it will be retried up to
–low-level-retries times.

Auth Proxy

If you supply the parameter --auth-proxy /path/to/program then rclone
will use that program to generate backends on the fly which then are
used to authenticate incoming requests. This uses a simple JSON based
protocl with input on STDIN and output on STDOUT.

There is an example program bin/test_proxy.py in the rclone source code.

The program’s job is to take a user and pass on the input and turn those
into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON format. This config will
have any default parameters for the backend added, but it won’t use
configuration from environment variables or command line options - it is
the job of the proxy program to make a complete config.

This config generated must have this extra parameter - _root - root to
use for the backend

And it may have this parameter - _obscure - comma separated strings for
parameters to obscure

For example the program might take this on STDIN

    {
        "user": "me",
        "pass": "mypassword"
    }

And return this on STDOUT

    {
        "type": "sftp",
        "_root": "",
        "_obscure": "pass",
        "user": "me",
        "pass": "mypassword",
        "host": "sftp.example.com"
    }

This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for the
user and pass returned in the output to the host given. Note that since
_obscure is set to pass, rclone will obscure the pass parameter before
creating the backend (which is required for sftp backends).

The progam can manipulate the supplied user in any way, for example to
make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make the user be
user@example.com and then set the host to example.com in the output and
the user to user. For security you’d probably want to restrict the host
to a limited list.

Note that an internal cache is keyed on user so only use that for
configuration, don’t use pass. This also means that if a user’s password
is changed the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins) before it
takes effect.

This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of backend
that rclone supports.

rclone serve webdav

Serve remote:path over webdav.

Synopsis

rclone serve webdav implements a basic webdav server to serve the remote
over HTTP via the webdav protocol. This can be viewed with a webdav
client, through a web browser, or you can make a remote of type webdav
to read and write it.

Webdav options

–etag-hash

This controls the ETag header. Without this flag the ETag will be based
on the ModTime and Size of the object.

If this flag is set to “auto” then rclone will choose the first
supported hash on the backend or you can use a named hash such as “MD5”
or “SHA-1”.

Use “rclone hashsum” to see the full list.

Server options

Use –addr to specify which IP address and port the server should listen
on, eg –addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or –addr :8080 to listen to all IPs. By
default it only listens on localhost. You can use port :0 to let the OS
choose an available port.

If you set –addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address then
using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

–server-read-timeout and –server-write-timeout can be used to control
the timeouts on the server. Note that this is the total time for a
transfer.

–max-header-bytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server will
accept in the HTTP header.

–baseurl controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from. By default
rclone will serve from the root. If you used –baseurl “/rclone” then
rclone would serve from a URL starting with “/rclone/”. This is useful
if you wish to proxy rclone serve. Rclone automatically inserts leading
and trailing “/” on –baseurl, so –baseurl “rclone”, –baseurl “/rclone”
and –baseurl “/rclone/” are all treated identically.

Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or set
a single username and password with the –user and –pass flags.

Use –htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd to provide an htpasswd file. This is in
standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic
authentication. Bcrypt is recommended.

To create an htpasswd file:

    touch htpasswd
    htpasswd -B htpasswd user
    htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser

The password file can be updated while rclone is running.

Use –realm to set the authentication realm.

SSL/TLS

By default this will serve over http. If you want you can serve over
https. You will need to supply the –cert and –key flags. If you wish to
do client side certificate validation then you will need to supply
–client-ca also.

–cert should be a either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation of
that with the CA certificate. –key should be the PEM encoded private key
and –client-ca should be the PEM encoded client certificate authority
certificate.

Directory Cache

Using the --dir-cache-time flag, you can set how long a directory should
be considered up to date and not refreshed from the backend. Changes
made locally in the mount may appear immediately or invalidate the
cache. However, changes done on the remote will only be picked up once
the cache expires.

Alternatively, you can send a SIGHUP signal to rclone for it to flush
all directory caches, regardless of how old they are. Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use rclone rc
to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

File Buffering

The --buffer-size flag determines the amount of memory, that will be
used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file descriptor will try to keep the specified amount of data
in memory at all times. The buffered data is bound to one file
descriptor and won’t be shared between multiple open file descriptors of
the same file.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per file descriptor. The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not yet
read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will be
used. The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
--buffer-size * open files.

File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. The VFS layer is used
by rclone mount to make a cloud storage system work more like a normal
file system.

You’ll need to enable VFS caching if you want, for example, to read and
write simultaneously to a file. See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache works in addition to the cache backend and you
may find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache. (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-mode string              Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default "off")
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects. (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size int             Max total size of objects in the cache. (default off)

If run with -vv rclone will print the location of the file cache. The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with --cache-dir or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by --vfs-cache-mode. The higher
the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the cost of using
disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are closed
so if rclone is quit or dies with open files then these won’t get
written back to the remote. However they will still be in the on disk
cache.

If using –vfs-cache-max-size note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons. Firstly because it is only checked every
–vfs-cache-poll-interval. Secondly because open files cannot be evicted
from the cache.

–vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

-   Files can’t be opened for both read AND write
-   Files opened for write can’t be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
-   Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
-   Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
-   If an upload fails it can’t be retried

–vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to “off” except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disks. This means that files opened for write
will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

-   Files opened for write only can’t be seeked
-   Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
-   Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
-   If an upload fails it can’t be retried

–vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from the
remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried up to –low-level-retries times.

–vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When a
file is opened for read it will be downloaded in its entirety first.

This may be appropriate for your needs, or you may prefer to look at the
cache backend which does a much more sophisticated job of caching,
including caching directory hierarchies and chunks of files.

In this mode, unlike the others, when a file is written to the disk, it
will be kept on the disk after it is written to the remote. It will be
purged on a schedule according to --vfs-cache-max-age.

    {

        "_root": "",
        "_obscure": "pass",
        "user": "me",
        "pass": "mypassword",
        "host": "sftp.example.com"
    }

rclone settier

Changes storage class/tier of objects in remote.

Synopsis

rclone settier changes storage tier or class at remote if supported. Few
cloud storage services provides different storage classes on objects,
for example AWS S3 and Glacier, Azure Blob storage - Hot, Cool and
Archive, Google Cloud Storage, Regional Storage, Nearline, Coldline etc.

Note that, certain tier changes make objects not available to access
immediately. For example tiering to archive in azure blob storage makes
objects in frozen state, user can restore by setting tier to Hot/Cool,
similarly S3 to Glacier makes object inaccessible.true

You can use it to tier single object

    rclone settier Cool remote:path/file

Or use rclone filters to set tier on only specific files

    rclone --include "*.txt" settier Hot remote:path/dir

Or just provide remote directory and all files in directory will be
tiered

    rclone settier tier remote:path/dir

rclone tree

List the contents of the remote in a tree like fashion.

Synopsis

rclone tree lists the contents of a remote in a similar way to the unix
tree command.

For example

    $ rclone tree remote:path
    /
    ├── file1
    ├── file2
    ├── file3
    └── subdir
        ├── file4
        └── file5

    1 directories, 5 files

You can use any of the filtering options with the tree command (eg
–include and –exclude). You can also use –fast-list.

The tree command has many options for controlling the listing which are
compatible with the tree command. Note that not all of them have short
options as they conflict with rclone’s short options.

    rclone tree remote:path [flags]

      -U, --unsorted        Leave files unsorted.
          --version         Sort files alphanumerically by version.

See the global flags page for global options not listed here.

Copying single files

rclone normally syncs or copies directories. However, if the source
remote points to a file, rclone will just copy that file. The
destination remote must point to a directory - rclone will give the
error
Failed to create file system for "remote:file": is a file not a directory
if it isn’t.

For example, suppose you have a remote with a file in called test.jpg,
then you could copy just that file like this

    rclone copy remote:test.jpg /tmp/download

The file test.jpg will be placed inside /tmp/download.

This is equivalent to specifying

    rclone copy --files-from /tmp/files remote: /tmp/download

Where /tmp/files contains the single line

    test.jpg

It is recommended to use copy when copying individual files, not sync.
They have pretty much the same effect but copy will use a lot less
memory.


Syntax of remote paths

The syntax of the paths passed to the rclone command are as follows.

/path/to/dir

This refers to the local file system.

On Windows only \ may be used instead of / in local paths ONLY, non
local paths must use /.

These paths needn’t start with a leading / - if they don’t then they
will be relative to the current directory.

remote:path/to/dir

This refers to a directory path/to/dir on remote: as defined in the
config file (configured with rclone config).

remote:/path/to/dir

On most backends this is refers to the same directory as
remote:path/to/dir and that format should be preferred. On a very small
number of remotes (FTP, SFTP, Dropbox for business) this will refer to a
different directory. On these, paths without a leading / will refer to
your “home” directory and paths with a leading / will refer to the root.

:backend:path/to/dir

This is an advanced form for creating remotes on the fly. backend should
be the name or prefix of a backend (the type in the config file) and all
the configuration for the backend should be provided on the command line
(or in environment variables).

Here are some examples:

    rclone lsd --http-url https://pub.rclone.org :http:

To list all the directories in the root of https://pub.rclone.org/.

    rclone lsf --http-url https://example.com :http:path/to/dir

To list files and directories in https://example.com/path/to/dir/

    rclone copy --http-url https://example.com :http:path/to/dir /tmp/dir

To copy files and directories in https://example.com/path/to/dir to
/tmp/dir.

    rclone copy --sftp-host example.com :sftp:path/to/dir /tmp/dir

To copy files and directories from example.com in the relative directory
path/to/dir to /tmp/dir using sftp.


Quoting and the shell

When you are typing commands to your computer you are using something
called the command line shell. This interprets various characters in an
OS specific way.

Here are some gotchas which may help users unfamiliar with the shell
rules

Linux / OSX

If your names have spaces or shell metacharacters (eg *, ?, $, ', " etc)
then you must quote them. Use single quotes ' by default.

    rclone copy 'Important files?' remote:backup

If you want to send a ' you will need to use ", eg

    rclone copy "O'Reilly Reviews" remote:backup

The rules for quoting metacharacters are complicated and if you want the
full details you’ll have to consult the manual page for your shell.

Windows

If your names have spaces in you need to put them in ", eg

    rclone copy "E:\folder name\folder name\folder name" remote:backup

If you are using the root directory on its own then don’t quote it (see
#464 for why), eg

    rclone copy E:\ remote:backup


Copying files or directories with : in the names

rclone uses : to mark a remote name. This is, however, a valid filename
component in non-Windows OSes. The remote name parser will only search
for a : up to the first / so if you need to act on a file or directory
like this then use the full path starting with a /, or use ./ as a
current directory prefix.

So to sync a directory called sync:me to a remote called remote: use

    rclone sync ./sync:me remote:path

or

    rclone sync /full/path/to/sync:me remote:path


Server Side Copy

Most remotes (but not all - see the overview) support server side copy.

This means if you want to copy one folder to another then rclone won’t
download all the files and re-upload them; it will instruct the server
to copy them in place.

Eg

    rclone copy s3:oldbucket s3:newbucket

Will copy the contents of oldbucket to newbucket without downloading and
re-uploading.

Remotes which don’t support server side copy WILL download and re-upload
in this case.

Server side copies are used with sync and copy and will be identified in
the log when using the -v flag. The move command may also use them if
remote doesn’t support server side move directly. This is done by
issuing a server side copy then a delete which is much quicker than a
download and re-upload.

Server side copies will only be attempted if the remote names are the
same.

This can be used when scripting to make aged backups efficiently, eg

    rclone sync remote:current-backup remote:previous-backup
    rclone sync /path/to/files remote:current-backup


Options

Rclone has a number of options to control its behaviour.

Options that take parameters can have the values passed in two ways,
--option=value or --option value. However boolean (true/false) options
behave slightly differently to the other options in that --boolean sets
the option to true and the absence of the flag sets it to false. It is
also possible to specify --boolean=false or --boolean=true. Note that
--boolean false is not valid - this is parsed as --boolean and the false
is parsed as an extra command line argument for rclone.

Options which use TIME use the go time parser. A duration string is a
possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction
and a unit suffix, such as “300ms”, “-1.5h” or “2h45m”. Valid time units
are “ns”, “us” (or “µs”), “ms”, “s”, “m”, “h”.

Options which use SIZE use kByte by default. However, a suffix of b for
bytes, k for kBytes, M for MBytes, G for GBytes, T for TBytes and P for
PBytes may be used. These are the binary units, eg 1, 2**10, 2**20,
2**30 respectively.

–backup-dir=DIR

When using sync, copy or move any files which would have been
overwritten or deleted are moved in their original hierarchy into this
directory.

If --suffix is set, then the moved files will have the suffix added to
them. If there is a file with the same path (after the suffix has been
added) in DIR, then it will be overwritten.

The remote in use must support server side move or copy and you must use
the same remote as the destination of the sync. The backup directory
must not overlap the destination directory.

For example

    rclone sync /path/to/local remote:current --backup-dir remote:old

will sync /path/to/local to remote:current, but for any files which
would have been updated or deleted will be stored in remote:old.

If running rclone from a script you might want to use today’s date as
the directory name passed to --backup-dir to store the old files, or you
might want to pass --suffix with today’s date.

See --compare-dest and --copy-dest.

–bind string

Local address to bind to for outgoing connections. This can be an IPv4
address (1.2.3.4), an IPv6 address (1234::789A) or host name. If the
host name doesn’t resolve or resolves to more than one IP address it
will give an error.

–bwlimit=BANDWIDTH_SPEC

This option controls the bandwidth limit. Limits can be specified in two
ways: As a single limit, or as a timetable.

Single limits last for the duration of the session. To use a single
limit, specify the desired bandwidth in kBytes/s, or use a suffix
b|k|M|G. The default is 0 which means to not limit bandwidth.

For example, to limit bandwidth usage to 10 MBytes/s use --bwlimit 10M

It is also possible to specify a “timetable” of limits, which will cause
certain limits to be applied at certain times. To specify a timetable,
format your entries as “WEEKDAY-HH:MM,BANDWIDTH
WEEKDAY-HH:MM,BANDWIDTH…” where: WEEKDAY is optional element. It could
be written as whole world or only using 3 first characters. HH:MM is an
hour from 00:00 to 23:59.

An example of a typical timetable to avoid link saturation during
daytime working hours could be:

--bwlimit "08:00,512 12:00,10M 13:00,512 18:00,30M 23:00,off"

In this example, the transfer bandwidth will be every day set to
512kBytes/sec at 8am. At noon, it will raise to 10Mbytes/s, and drop
back to 512kBytes/sec at 1pm. At 6pm, the bandwidth limit will be set to
30MBytes/s, and at 11pm it will be completely disabled (full speed).
Anything between 11pm and 8am will remain unlimited.

An example of timetable with WEEKDAY could be:

--bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512 Fri-23:59,10M Sat-10:00,1M Sun-20:00,off"

It mean that, the transfer bandwidth will be set to 512kBytes/sec on
Monday. It will raise to 10Mbytes/s before the end of Friday. At 10:00
on Sunday it will be set to 1Mbyte/s. From 20:00 at Sunday will be
unlimited.

Timeslots without weekday are extended to whole week. So this one
example:

--bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512 12:00,1M Sun-20:00,off"

Is equal to this:

--bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512Mon-12:00,1M Tue-12:00,1M Wed-12:00,1M Thu-12:00,1M Fri-12:00,1M Sat-12:00,1M Sun-12:00,1M Sun-20:00,off"

Bandwidth limits only apply to the data transfer. They don’t apply to
the bandwidth of the directory listings etc.

Note that the units are Bytes/s, not Bits/s. Typically connections are
measured in Bits/s - to convert divide by 8. For example, let’s say you
have a 10 Mbit/s connection and you wish rclone to use half of it - 5
Mbit/s. This is 5/8 = 0.625MByte/s so you would use a --bwlimit 0.625M
parameter for rclone.

On Unix systems (Linux, MacOS, …) the bandwidth limiter can be toggled
by sending a SIGUSR2 signal to rclone. This allows to remove the
limitations of a long running rclone transfer and to restore it back to
the value specified with --bwlimit quickly when needed. Assuming there
is only one rclone instance running, you can toggle the limiter like
this:

    kill -SIGUSR2 $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a remote control then you can use change
the bwlimit dynamically:

    rclone rc core/bwlimit rate=1M

–buffer-size=SIZE

Use this sized buffer to speed up file transfers. Each --transfer will
use this much memory for buffering.

When using mount or cmount each open file descriptor will use this much
memory for buffering. See the mount documentation for more details.

Set to 0 to disable the buffering for the minimum memory usage.

Note that the memory allocation of the buffers is influenced by the
–use-mmap flag.

–checkers=N

The number of checkers to run in parallel. Checkers do the equality
checking of files during a sync. For some storage systems (eg S3, Swift,
Dropbox) this can take a significant amount of time so they are run in
parallel.

The default is to run 8 checkers in parallel.

-c, –checksum

Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal. If you set this flag then rclone will check the file
hash and size to determine if files are equal.

This is useful when the remote doesn’t support setting modified time and
a more accurate sync is desired than just checking the file size.

This is very useful when transferring between remotes which store the
same hash type on the object, eg Drive and Swift. For details of which
remotes support which hash type see the table in the overview section.

Eg rclone --checksum sync s3:/bucket swift:/bucket would run much
quicker than without the --checksum flag.

When using this flag, rclone won’t update mtimes of remote files if they
are incorrect as it would normally.

–compare-dest=DIR

When using sync, copy or move DIR is checked in addition to the
destination for files. If a file identical to the source is found that
file is NOT copied from source. This is useful to copy just files that
have changed since the last backup.

You must use the same remote as the destination of the sync. The compare
directory must not overlap the destination directory.

See --copy-dest and --backup-dir.

–config=CONFIG_FILE

Specify the location of the rclone config file.

Normally the config file is in your home directory as a file called
.config/rclone/rclone.conf (or .rclone.conf if created with an older
version). If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set it will be at
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rclone/rclone.conf.

If there is a file rclone.conf in the same directory as the rclone
executable it will be preferred. This file must be created manually for
Rclone to use it, it will never be created automatically.

If you run rclone config file you will see where the default location is
for you.

Use this flag to override the config location, eg
rclone --config=".myconfig" .config.

–contimeout=TIME

Set the connection timeout. This should be in go time format which looks
like 5s for 5 seconds, 10m for 10 minutes, or 3h30m.

The connection timeout is the amount of time rclone will wait for a
connection to go through to a remote object storage system. It is 1m by
default.

–copy-dest=DIR

When using sync, copy or move DIR is checked in addition to the
destination for files. If a file identical to the source is found that
file is server side copied from DIR to the destination. This is useful
for incremental backup.

The remote in use must support server side copy and you must use the
same remote as the destination of the sync. The compare directory must
not overlap the destination directory.

See --compare-dest and --backup-dir.

–dedupe-mode MODE

Mode to run dedupe command in. One of interactive, skip, first, newest,
oldest, rename. The default is interactive. See the dedupe command for
more information as to what these options mean.

–disable FEATURE,FEATURE,…

This disables a comma separated list of optional features. For example
to disable server side move and server side copy use:

    --disable move,copy

The features can be put in in any case.

To see a list of which features can be disabled use:

    --disable help

See the overview features and optional features to get an idea of which
feature does what.

This flag can be useful for debugging and in exceptional circumstances
(eg Google Drive limiting the total volume of Server Side Copies to
100GB/day).

-n, –dry-run

Do a trial run with no permanent changes. Use this to see what rclone
would do without actually doing it. Useful when setting up the sync
command which deletes files in the destination.

–ignore-case-sync

Using this option will cause rclone to ignore the case of the files when
synchronizing so files will not be copied/synced when the existing
filenames are the same, even if the casing is different.

–ignore-checksum

Normally rclone will check that the checksums of transferred files
match, and give an error “corrupted on transfer” if they don’t.

You can use this option to skip that check. You should only use it if
you have had the “corrupted on transfer” error message and you are sure
you might want to transfer potentially corrupted data.

–ignore-existing

Using this option will make rclone unconditionally skip all files that
exist on the destination, no matter the content of these files.

While this isn’t a generally recommended option, it can be useful in
cases where your files change due to encryption. However, it cannot
correct partial transfers in case a transfer was interrupted.

–ignore-size

Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal. If you set this flag then rclone will check only the
modification time. If --checksum is set then it only checks the
checksum.

It will also cause rclone to skip verifying the sizes are the same after
transfer.

This can be useful for transferring files to and from OneDrive which
occasionally misreports the size of image files (see #399 for more
info).

-I, –ignore-times

Using this option will cause rclone to unconditionally upload all files
regardless of the state of files on the destination.

Normally rclone would skip any files that have the same modification
time and are the same size (or have the same checksum if using
--checksum).

–immutable

Treat source and destination files as immutable and disallow
modification.

With this option set, files will be created and deleted as requested,
but existing files will never be updated. If an existing file does not
match between the source and destination, rclone will give the error
Source and destination exist but do not match: immutable file modified.

Note that only commands which transfer files (e.g. sync, copy, move) are
affected by this behavior, and only modification is disallowed. Files
may still be deleted explicitly (e.g. delete, purge) or implicitly
(e.g. sync, move). Use copy --immutable if it is desired to avoid
deletion as well as modification.

This can be useful as an additional layer of protection for immutable or
append-only data sets (notably backup archives), where modification
implies corruption and should not be propagated.


–leave-root

During rmdirs it will not remove root directory, even if it’s empty.

–log-file=FILE

Log all of rclone’s output to FILE. This is not active by default. This
can be useful for tracking down problems with syncs in combination with
the -v flag. See the Logging section for more info.

Note that if you are using the logrotate program to manage rclone’s
logs, then you should use the copytruncate option as rclone doesn’t have
a signal to rotate logs.

–log-format LIST

Comma separated list of log format options. date, time, microseconds,
longfile, shortfile, UTC. The default is “date,time”.

–log-level LEVEL

This sets the log level for rclone. The default log level is NOTICE.

DEBUG is equivalent to -vv. It outputs lots of debug info - useful for
bug reports and really finding out what rclone is doing.

INFO is equivalent to -v. It outputs information about each transfer and
prints stats once a minute by default.

NOTICE is the default log level if no logging flags are supplied. It
outputs very little when things are working normally. It outputs
warnings and significant events.

ERROR is equivalent to -q. It only outputs error messages.

–use-json-log

This switches the log format to JSON for rclone. The fields of json log
are level, msg, source, time.

–low-level-retries NUMBER

This controls the number of low level retries rclone does.

A low level retry is used to retry a failing operation - typically one
HTTP request. This might be uploading a chunk of a big file for example.
You will see low level retries in the log with the -v flag.

This shouldn’t need to be changed from the default in normal operations.
However, if you get a lot of low level retries you may wish to reduce
the value so rclone moves on to a high level retry (see the --retries
flag) quicker.

Disable low level retries with --low-level-retries 1.

–max-backlog=N

This is the maximum allowable backlog of files in a sync/copy/move
queued for being checked or transferred.

This can be set arbitrarily large. It will only use memory when the
queue is in use. Note that it will use in the order of N kB of memory
when the backlog is in use.

Setting this large allows rclone to calculate how many files are pending
more accurately and give a more accurate estimated finish time.

Setting this small will make rclone more synchronous to the listings of
the remote which may be desirable.

–max-delete=N

This tells rclone not to delete more than N files. If that limit is
exceeded then a fatal error will be generated and rclone will stop the
operation in progress.

–max-depth=N

This modifies the recursion depth for all the commands except purge.

So if you do rclone --max-depth 1 ls remote:path you will see only the
files in the top level directory. Using --max-depth 2 means you will see
all the files in first two directory levels and so on.

For historical reasons the lsd command defaults to using a --max-depth
of 1 - you can override this with the command line flag.

You can use this command to disable recursion (with --max-depth 1).

Note that if you use this with sync and --delete-excluded the files not
recursed through are considered excluded and will be deleted on the
destination. Test first with --dry-run if you are not sure what will
happen.

–max-transfer=SIZE

Rclone will stop transferring when it has reached the size specified.
Defaults to off.

When the limit is reached all transfers will stop immediately.

Rclone will exit with exit code 8 if the transfer limit is reached.

–modify-window=TIME

When checking whether a file has been modified, this is the maximum
allowed time difference that a file can have and still be considered
equivalent.

The default is 1ns unless this is overridden by a remote. For example OS
X only stores modification times to the nearest second so if you are
reading and writing to an OS X filing system this will be 1s by default.

This command line flag allows you to override that computed default.

–multi-thread-cutoff=SIZE

When downloading files to the local backend above this size, rclone will
use multiple threads to download the file. (default 250M)

Rclone preallocates the file (using fallocate(FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE) on
unix or NTSetInformationFile on Windows both of which takes no time)
then each thread writes directly into the file at the correct place.
This means that rclone won’t create fragmented or sparse files and there
won’t be any assembly time at the end of the transfer.

The number of threads used to dowload is controlled by
--multi-thread-streams.

Use -vv if you wish to see info about the threads.

This will work with the sync/copy/move commands and friends
copyto/moveto. Multi thread downloads will be used with rclone mount and
rclone serve if --vfs-cache-mode is set to writes or above.

NB that this ONLY works for a local destination but will work with any
source.

NB that multi thread copies are disabled for local to local copies as
they are faster without unless --multi-thread-streams is set explicitly.

–multi-thread-streams=N

When using multi thread downloads (see above --multi-thread-cutoff) this
sets the maximum number of streams to use. Set to 0 to disable multi
thread downloads. (Default 4)

Exactly how many streams rclone uses for the download depends on the
size of the file. To calculate the number of download streams Rclone
divides the size of the file by the --multi-thread-cutoff and rounds up,
up to the maximum set with --multi-thread-streams.

So if --multi-thread-cutoff 250MB and --multi-thread-streams 4 are in
effect (the defaults):

-   0MB.250MB files will be downloaded with 1 stream
-   250MB..500MB files will be downloaded with 2 streams
-   500MB..750MB files will be downloaded with 3 streams
-   750MB+ files will be downloaded with 4 streams

–no-gzip-encoding

Don’t set Accept-Encoding: gzip. This means that rclone won’t ask the
server for compressed files automatically. Useful if you’ve set the
server to return files with Content-Encoding: gzip but you uploaded
compressed files.

There is no need to set this in normal operation, and doing so will
decrease the network transfer efficiency of rclone.

–no-traverse

The --no-traverse flag controls whether the destination file system is
traversed when using the copy or move commands. --no-traverse is not
compatible with sync and will be ignored if you supply it with sync.

If you are only copying a small number of files (or are filtering most
of the files) and/or have a large number of files on the destination
then --no-traverse will stop rclone listing the destination and save
time.

However, if you are copying a large number of files, especially if you
are doing a copy where lots of the files under consideration haven’t
changed and won’t need copying then you shouldn’t use --no-traverse.

See rclone copy for an example of how to use it.

–no-update-modtime

When using this flag, rclone won’t update modification times of remote
files if they are incorrect as it would normally.

This can be used if the remote is being synced with another tool also
(eg the Google Drive client).

-P, –progress

This flag makes rclone update the stats in a static block in the
terminal providing a realtime overview of the transfer.

Any log messages will scroll above the static block. Log messages will
push the static block down to the bottom of the terminal where it will
stay.

Normally this is updated every 500mS but this period can be overridden
with the --stats flag.

This can be used with the --stats-one-line flag for a simpler display.

Note: On Windows untilthis bug is fixed all non-ASCII characters will be
replaced with . when --progress is in use.

-q, –quiet

Normally rclone outputs stats and a completion message. If you set this
flag it will make as little output as possible.

–retries int

Retry the entire sync if it fails this many times it fails (default 3).

Some remotes can be unreliable and a few retries help pick up the files
which didn’t get transferred because of errors.

Disable retries with --retries 1.

–retries-sleep=TIME

This sets the interval between each retry specified by --retries

The default is 0. Use 0 to disable.

–size-only

Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to see
if they are equal. If you set this flag then rclone will check only the
size.

This can be useful transferring files from Dropbox which have been
modified by the desktop sync client which doesn’t set checksums of
modification times in the same way as rclone.

–stats=TIME

Commands which transfer data (sync, copy, copyto, move, moveto) will
print data transfer stats at regular intervals to show their progress.

This sets the interval.

The default is 1m. Use 0 to disable.

If you set the stats interval then all commands can show stats. This can
be useful when running other commands, check or mount for example.

Stats are logged at INFO level by default which means they won’t show at
default log level NOTICE. Use --stats-log-level NOTICE or -v to make
them show. See the Logging section for more info on log levels.

Note that on macOS you can send a SIGINFO (which is normally ctrl-T in
the terminal) to make the stats print immediately.

–stats-file-name-length integer

By default, the --stats output will truncate file names and paths longer
than 40 characters. This is equivalent to providing
--stats-file-name-length 40. Use --stats-file-name-length 0 to disable
any truncation of file names printed by stats.

–stats-log-level string

Log level to show --stats output at. This can be DEBUG, INFO, NOTICE, or
ERROR. The default is INFO. This means at the default level of logging
which is NOTICE the stats won’t show - if you want them to then use
--stats-log-level NOTICE. See the Logging section for more info on log
levels.

–stats-one-line

When this is specified, rclone condenses the stats into a single line
showing the most important stats only.

–stats-one-line-date

When this is specified, rclone enables the single-line stats and
prepends the display with a date string. The default is
2006/01/02 15:04:05 -

–stats-one-line-date-format

When this is specified, rclone enables the single-line stats and
prepends the display with a user-supplied date string. The date string
MUST be enclosed in quotes. Follow golang specs for date formatting
syntax.

–stats-unit=bits|bytes

By default, data transfer rates will be printed in bytes/second.

This option allows the data rate to be printed in bits/second.

Data transfer volume will still be reported in bytes.

The rate is reported as a binary unit, not SI unit. So 1 Mbit/s equals
1,048,576 bits/s and not 1,000,000 bits/s.

The default is bytes.

–suffix=SUFFIX

When using sync, copy or move any files which would have been
overwritten or deleted will have the suffix added to them. If there is a
file with the same path (after the suffix has been added), then it will
be overwritten.

The remote in use must support server side move or copy and you must use
the same remote as the destination of the sync.

This is for use with files to add the suffix in the current directory or
with --backup-dir. See --backup-dir for more info.

For example

    rclone sync /path/to/local/file remote:current --suffix .bak

will sync /path/to/local to remote:current, but for any files which
would have been updated or deleted have .bak added.

–suffix-keep-extension

When using --suffix, setting this causes rclone put the SUFFIX before
the extension of the files that it backs up rather than after.

So let’s say we had --suffix -2019-01-01, without the flag file.txt
would be backed up to file.txt-2019-01-01 and with the flag it would be
backed up to file-2019-01-01.txt. This can be helpful to make sure the
suffixed files can still be opened.

–syslog

On capable OSes (not Windows or Plan9) send all log output to syslog.

This can be useful for running rclone in a script or rclone mount.

–syslog-facility string

If using --syslog this sets the syslog facility (eg KERN, USER). See
man syslog for a list of possible facilities. The default facility is
DAEMON.

–tpslimit float

Limit HTTP transactions per second to this. Default is 0 which is used
to mean unlimited transactions per second.

For example to limit rclone to 10 HTTP transactions per second use
--tpslimit 10, or to 1 transaction every 2 seconds use --tpslimit 0.5.

Use this when the number of transactions per second from rclone is
causing a problem with the cloud storage provider (eg getting you banned
or rate limited).

This can be very useful for rclone mount to control the behaviour of
applications using it.

See also --tpslimit-burst.

–tpslimit-burst int

Max burst of transactions for --tpslimit. (default 1)

Normally --tpslimit will do exactly the number of transaction per second
specified. However if you supply --tps-burst then rclone can save up
some transactions from when it was idle giving a burst of up to the
parameter supplied.

For example if you provide --tpslimit-burst 10 then if rclone has been
idle for more than 10*--tpslimit then it can do 10 transactions very
quickly before they are limited again.

This may be used to increase performance of --tpslimit without changing
the long term average number of transactions per second.

–track-renames

By default, rclone doesn’t keep track of renamed files, so if you rename
a file locally then sync it to a remote, rclone will delete the old file
on the remote and upload a new copy.

If you use this flag, and the remote supports server side copy or server
side move, and the source and destination have a compatible hash, then
this will track renames during sync operations and perform renaming
server-side.

Files will be matched by size and hash - if both match then a rename
will be considered.

If the destination does not support server-side copy or move, rclone
will fall back to the default behaviour and log an error level message
to the console. Note: Encrypted destinations are not supported by
--track-renames.

Note that --track-renames is incompatible with --no-traverse and that it
uses extra memory to keep track of all the rename candidates.

Note also that --track-renames is incompatible with --delete-before and
will select --delete-after instead of --delete-during.

–delete-(before,during,after)

This option allows you to specify when files on your destination are
deleted when you sync folders.

Specifying the value --delete-before will delete all files present on
the destination, but not on the source _before_ starting the transfer of
any new or updated files. This uses two passes through the file systems,
one for the deletions and one for the copies.

Specifying --delete-during will delete files while checking and
uploading files. This is the fastest option and uses the least memory.

Specifying --delete-after (the default value) will delay deletion of
files until all new/updated files have been successfully transferred.
The files to be deleted are collected in the copy pass then deleted
after the copy pass has completed successfully. The files to be deleted
are held in memory so this mode may use more memory. This is the safest
mode as it will only delete files if there have been no errors
subsequent to that. If there have been errors before the deletions start
then you will get the message
not deleting files as there were IO errors.

–fast-list

When doing anything which involves a directory listing (eg sync, copy,
ls - in fact nearly every command), rclone normally lists a directory
and processes it before using more directory lists to process any
subdirectories. This can be parallelised and works very quickly using
the least amount of memory.

However, some remotes have a way of listing all files beneath a
directory in one (or a small number) of transactions. These tend to be
the bucket based remotes (eg S3, B2, GCS, Swift, Hubic).

If you use the --fast-list flag then rclone will use this method for
listing directories. This will have the following consequences for the
listing:

-   It WILL use fewer transactions (important if you pay for them)
-   It WILL use more memory. Rclone has to load the whole listing into
    memory.
-   It _may_ be faster because it uses fewer transactions
-   It _may_ be slower because it can’t be parallelized

rclone should always give identical results with and without
--fast-list.

If you pay for transactions and can fit your entire sync listing into
memory then --fast-list is recommended. If you have a very big sync to
do then don’t use --fast-list otherwise you will run out of memory.

If you use --fast-list on a remote which doesn’t support it, then rclone
will just ignore it.

–timeout=TIME

This sets the IO idle timeout. If a transfer has started but then
becomes idle for this long it is considered broken and disconnected.

The default is 5m. Set to 0 to disable.

–transfers=N

The number of file transfers to run in parallel. It can sometimes be
useful to set this to a smaller number if the remote is giving a lot of
timeouts or bigger if you have lots of bandwidth and a fast remote.

The default is to run 4 file transfers in parallel.

-u, –update

This forces rclone to skip any files which exist on the destination and
have a modified time that is newer than the source file.

This can be useful when transferring to a remote which doesn’t support
mod times directly (or when using --use-server-modtime to avoid extra
API calls) as it is more accurate than a --size-only check and faster
than using --checksum.

If an existing destination file has a modification time equal (within
the computed modify window precision) to the source file’s, it will be
updated if the sizes are different. If --checksum is set then rclone
will update the destination if the checksums differ too.

If an existing destination file is older than the source file then it
will be updated if the size or checksum differs from the source file.

On remotes which don’t support mod time directly (or when using
--use-server-modtime) the time checked will be the uploaded time. This
means that if uploading to one of these remotes, rclone will skip any
files which exist on the destination and have an uploaded time that is
newer than the modification time of the source file.

–use-mmap

If this flag is set then rclone will use anonymous memory allocated by
mmap on Unix based platforms and VirtualAlloc on Windows for its
transfer buffers (size controlled by --buffer-size). Memory allocated
like this does not go on the Go heap and can be returned to the OS
immediately when it is finished with.

If this flag is not set then rclone will allocate and free the buffers
using the Go memory allocator which may use more memory as memory pages
are returned less aggressively to the OS.

It is possible this does not work well on all platforms so it is
disabled by default; in the future it may be enabled by default.

–use-server-modtime

Some object-store backends (e.g, Swift, S3) do not preserve file
modification times (modtime). On these backends, rclone stores the
original modtime as additional metadata on the object. By default it
will make an API call to retrieve the metadata when the modtime is
needed by an operation.

Use this flag to disable the extra API call and rely instead on the
server’s modified time. In cases such as a local to remote sync using
--update, knowing the local file is newer than the time it was last
uploaded to the remote is sufficient. In those cases, this flag can
speed up the process and reduce the number of API calls necessary.

Using this flag on a sync operation without also using --update would
cause all files modified at any time other than the last upload time to
be uploaded again, which is probably not what you want.

-v, -vv, –verbose

With -v rclone will tell you about each file that is transferred and a
small number of significant events.

With -vv rclone will become very verbose telling you about every file it
considers and transfers. Please send bug reports with a log with this
setting.

-V, –version

Prints the version number


SSL/TLS options

The outoing SSL/TLS connections rclone makes can be controlled with
these options. For example this can be very useful with the HTTP or
WebDAV backends. Rclone HTTP servers have their own set of configuration
for SSL/TLS which you can find in their documentation.

–ca-cert string

This loads the PEM encoded certificate authority certificate and uses it
to verify the certificates of the servers rclone connects to.

If you have generated certificates signed with a local CA then you will
need this flag to connect to servers using those certificates.

–client-cert string

This loads the PEM encoded client side certificate.

This is used for mutual TLS authentication.

The --client-key flag is required too when using this.

–client-key string

This loads the PEM encoded client side private key used for mutual TLS
authentication. Used in conjunction with --client-cert.

–no-check-certificate=true/false

--no-check-certificate controls whether a client verifies the server’s
certificate chain and host name. If --no-check-certificate is true, TLS
accepts any certificate presented by the server and any host name in
that certificate. In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle
attacks.

This option defaults to false.

THIS SHOULD BE USED ONLY FOR TESTING.


Configuration Encryption

Your configuration file contains information for logging in to your
cloud services. This means that you should keep your .rclone.conf file
in a secure location.

If you are in an environment where that isn’t possible, you can add a
password to your configuration. This means that you will have to enter
the password every time you start rclone.

To add a password to your rclone configuration, execute rclone config.

    >rclone config
    Current remotes:

    e) Edit existing remote
    n) New remote
    d) Delete remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/s/q>

Go into s, Set configuration password:

    e/n/d/s/q> s
    Your configuration is not encrypted.
    If you add a password, you will protect your login information to cloud services.
    a) Add Password
    q) Quit to main menu
    a/q> a
    Enter NEW configuration password:
    password:
    Confirm NEW password:
    password:
    Password set
    Your configuration is encrypted.
    c) Change Password
    u) Unencrypt configuration
    q) Quit to main menu
    c/u/q>

Your configuration is now encrypted, and every time you start rclone you
will now be asked for the password. In the same menu, you can change the
password or completely remove encryption from your configuration.

There is no way to recover the configuration if you lose your password.

rclone uses nacl secretbox which in turn uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to
encrypt and authenticate your configuration with secret-key
cryptography. The password is SHA-256 hashed, which produces the key for
secretbox. The hashed password is not stored.

While this provides very good security, we do not recommend storing your
encrypted rclone configuration in public if it contains sensitive
information, maybe except if you use a very strong password.

If it is safe in your environment, you can set the RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
environment variable to contain your password, in which case it will be
used for decrypting the configuration.

You can set this for a session from a script. For unix like systems save
this to a file called set-rclone-password:

    #!/bin/echo Source this file don't run it

    read -s RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
    export RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS

Then source the file when you want to use it. From the shell you would
do source set-rclone-password. It will then ask you for the password and
set it in the environment variable.

If you are running rclone inside a script, you might want to disable
password prompts. To do that, pass the parameter --ask-password=false to
rclone. This will make rclone fail instead of asking for a password if
RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS doesn’t contain a valid password.


Developer options

These options are useful when developing or debugging rclone. There are
also some more remote specific options which aren’t documented here
which are used for testing. These start with remote name eg
--drive-test-option - see the docs for the remote in question.

–cpuprofile=FILE

Write CPU profile to file. This can be analysed with go tool pprof.

–dump flag,flag,flag

The --dump flag takes a comma separated list of flags to dump info
about. These are:

–dump headers

Dump HTTP headers with Authorization: lines removed. May still contain
sensitive info. Can be very verbose. Useful for debugging only.

Use --dump auth if you do want the Authorization: headers.

–dump bodies

Dump HTTP headers and bodies - may contain sensitive info. Can be very
verbose. Useful for debugging only.

Note that the bodies are buffered in memory so don’t use this for
enormous files.

–dump requests

Like --dump bodies but dumps the request bodies and the response
headers. Useful for debugging download problems.

–dump responses

Like --dump bodies but dumps the response bodies and the request
headers. Useful for debugging upload problems.

–dump auth

Dump HTTP headers - will contain sensitive info such as Authorization:
headers - use --dump headers to dump without Authorization: headers. Can
be very verbose. Useful for debugging only.

–dump filters

Dump the filters to the output. Useful to see exactly what include and
exclude options are filtering on.

–dump goroutines

This dumps a list of the running go-routines at the end of the command
to standard output.

–dump openfiles

This dumps a list of the open files at the end of the command. It uses
the lsof command to do that so you’ll need that installed to use it.

–memprofile=FILE

Write memory profile to file. This can be analysed with go tool pprof.


Filtering

For the filtering options

-   --delete-excluded
-   --filter
-   --filter-from
-   --exclude
-   --exclude-from
-   --include
-   --include-from
-   --files-from
-   --min-size
-   --max-size
-   --min-age
-   --max-age
-   --dump filters

See the filtering section.


Remote control

For the remote control options and for instructions on how to remote
control rclone

-   --rc
-   and anything starting with --rc-

See the remote control section.


Logging

rclone has 4 levels of logging, ERROR, NOTICE, INFO and DEBUG.

By default, rclone logs to standard error. This means you can redirect
standard error and still see the normal output of rclone commands (eg
rclone ls).

By default, rclone will produce Error and Notice level messages.

If you use the -q flag, rclone will only produce Error messages.

If you use the -v flag, rclone will produce Error, Notice and Info
messages.

If you use the -vv flag, rclone will produce Error, Notice, Info and
Debug messages.

You can also control the log levels with the --log-level flag.

If you use the --log-file=FILE option, rclone will redirect Error, Info
and Debug messages along with standard error to FILE.

If you use the --syslog flag then rclone will log to syslog and the
--syslog-facility control which facility it uses.

Rclone prefixes all log messages with their level in capitals, eg INFO
which makes it easy to grep the log file for different kinds of
information.


Exit Code

If any errors occur during the command execution, rclone will exit with
a non-zero exit code. This allows scripts to detect when rclone
operations have failed.

During the startup phase, rclone will exit immediately if an error is
detected in the configuration. There will always be a log message
immediately before exiting.

When rclone is running it will accumulate errors as it goes along, and
only exit with a non-zero exit code if (after retries) there were still
failed transfers. For every error counted there will be a high priority
log message (visible with -q) showing the message and which file caused
the problem. A high priority message is also shown when starting a retry
so the user can see that any previous error messages may not be valid
after the retry. If rclone has done a retry it will log a high priority
message if the retry was successful.

List of exit codes

-   0 - success
-   1 - Syntax or usage error
-   2 - Error not otherwise categorised
-   3 - Directory not found
-   4 - File not found
-   5 - Temporary error (one that more retries might fix) (Retry errors)
-   6 - Less serious errors (like 461 errors from dropbox) (NoRetry
    errors)
-   7 - Fatal error (one that more retries won’t fix, like account
    suspended) (Fatal errors)
-   8 - Transfer exceeded - limit set by –max-transfer reached


Environment Variables

Rclone can be configured entirely using environment variables. These can
be used to set defaults for options or config file entries.

Options

Every option in rclone can have its default set by environment variable.

To find the name of the environment variable, first, take the long
option name, strip the leading --, change - to _, make upper case and
prepend RCLONE_.

For example, to always set --stats 5s, set the environment variable
RCLONE_STATS=5s. If you set stats on the command line this will override
the environment variable setting.

Or to always use the trash in drive --drive-use-trash, set
RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_TRASH=true.

The same parser is used for the options and the environment variables so
they take exactly the same form.

Config file

You can set defaults for values in the config file on an individual
remote basis. If you want to use this feature, you will need to discover
the name of the config items that you want. The easiest way is to run
through rclone config by hand, then look in the config file to see what
the values are (the config file can be found by looking at the help for
--config in rclone help).

To find the name of the environment variable, you need to set, take
RCLONE_CONFIG_ + name of remote + _ + name of config file option and
make it all uppercase.

For example, to configure an S3 remote named mys3: without a config file
(using unix ways of setting environment variables):

    $ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_TYPE=s3
    $ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
    $ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXX
    $ rclone lsd MYS3:
              -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket
    $ rclone listremotes | grep mys3
    mys3:

Note that if you want to create a remote using environment variables you
must create the ..._TYPE variable as above.

Other environment variables

-   RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS` set to contain your config file password (see
    Configuration Encryption section)
-   HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY (or the lowercase versions
    thereof).
    -   HTTPS_PROXY takes precedence over HTTP_PROXY for https requests.
    -   The environment values may be either a complete URL or a
        “host[:port]” for, in which case the “http” scheme is assumed.



CONFIGURING RCLONE ON A REMOTE / HEADLESS MACHINE


Some of the configurations (those involving oauth2) require an Internet
connected web browser.

If you are trying to set rclone up on a remote or headless box with no
browser available on it (eg a NAS or a server in a datacenter) then you
will need to use an alternative means of configuration. There are two
ways of doing it, described below.


Configuring using rclone authorize

On the headless box

    ...
    Remote config
    Use auto config?
     * Say Y if not sure
     * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> n
    For this to work, you will need rclone available on a machine that has a web browser available.
    Execute the following on your machine:
        rclone authorize "amazon cloud drive"
    Then paste the result below:
    result>

Then on your main desktop machine

    rclone authorize "amazon cloud drive"
    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    Paste the following into your remote machine --->
    SECRET_TOKEN
    <---End paste

Then back to the headless box, paste in the code

    result> SECRET_TOKEN
    --------------------
    [acd12]
    client_id = 
    client_secret = 
    token = SECRET_TOKEN
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d>


Configuring by copying the config file

Rclone stores all of its config in a single configuration file. This can
easily be copied to configure a remote rclone.

So first configure rclone on your desktop machine

    rclone config

to set up the config file.

Find the config file by running rclone config file, for example

    $ rclone config file
    Configuration file is stored at:
    /home/user/.rclone.conf

Now transfer it to the remote box (scp, cut paste, ftp, sftp etc) and
place it in the correct place (use rclone config file on the remote box
to find out where).



FILTERING, INCLUDES AND EXCLUDES


Rclone has a sophisticated set of include and exclude rules. Some of
these are based on patterns and some on other things like file size.

The filters are applied for the copy, sync, move, ls, lsl, md5sum,
sha1sum, size, delete and check operations. Note that purge does not
obey the filters.

Each path as it passes through rclone is matched against the include and
exclude rules like --include, --exclude, --include-from, --exclude-from,
--filter, or --filter-from. The simplest way to try them out is using
the ls command, or --dry-run together with -v.


Patterns

The patterns used to match files for inclusion or exclusion are based on
“file globs” as used by the unix shell.

If the pattern starts with a / then it only matches at the top level of
the directory tree, RELATIVE TO THE ROOT OF THE REMOTE (not necessarily
the root of the local drive). If it doesn’t start with / then it is
matched starting at the END OF THE PATH, but it will only match a
complete path element:

    file.jpg  - matches "file.jpg"
              - matches "directory/file.jpg"
              - doesn't match "afile.jpg"
              - doesn't match "directory/afile.jpg"
    /file.jpg - matches "file.jpg" in the root directory of the remote
              - doesn't match "afile.jpg"
              - doesn't match "directory/file.jpg"

IMPORTANT Note that you must use / in patterns and not \ even if running
on Windows.

A * matches anything but not a /.

    *.jpg  - matches "file.jpg"
           - matches "directory/file.jpg"
           - doesn't match "file.jpg/something"

Use ** to match anything, including slashes (/).

    dir/** - matches "dir/file.jpg"
           - matches "dir/dir1/dir2/file.jpg"
           - doesn't match "directory/file.jpg"
           - doesn't match "adir/file.jpg"

A ? matches any character except a slash /.

    l?ss  - matches "less"
          - matches "lass"
          - doesn't match "floss"

A [ and ] together make a character class, such as [a-z] or [aeiou] or
[[:alpha:]]. See the go regexp docs for more info on these.

    h[ae]llo - matches "hello"
             - matches "hallo"
             - doesn't match "hullo"

A { and } define a choice between elements. It should contain a comma
separated list of patterns, any of which might match. These patterns can
contain wildcards.

    {one,two}_potato - matches "one_potato"
                     - matches "two_potato"
                     - doesn't match "three_potato"
                     - doesn't match "_potato"

Special characters can be escaped with a \ before them.

    \*.jpg       - matches "*.jpg"
    \\.jpg       - matches "\.jpg"
    \[one\].jpg  - matches "[one].jpg"

Patterns are case sensitive unless the --ignore-case flag is used.

Without --ignore-case (default)

    potato - matches "potato"
           - doesn't match "POTATO"

With --ignore-case

    potato - matches "potato"
           - matches "POTATO"

Note also that rclone filter globs can only be used in one of the filter
command line flags, not in the specification of the remote, so
rclone copy "remote:dir*.jpg" /path/to/dir won’t work - what is required
is rclone --include "*.jpg" copy remote:dir /path/to/dir

Directories

Rclone keeps track of directories that could match any file patterns.

Eg if you add the include rule

    /a/*.jpg

Rclone will synthesize the directory include rule

    /a/

If you put any rules which end in / then it will only match directories.

Directory matches are ONLY used to optimise directory access patterns -
you must still match the files that you want to match. Directory matches
won’t optimise anything on bucket based remotes (eg s3, swift, google
compute storage, b2) which don’t have a concept of directory.

Differences between rsync and rclone patterns

Rclone implements bash style {a,b,c} glob matching which rsync doesn’t.

Rclone always does a wildcard match so \ must always escape a \.


How the rules are used

Rclone maintains a combined list of include rules and exclude rules.

Each file is matched in order, starting from the top, against the rule
in the list until it finds a match. The file is then included or
excluded according to the rule type.

If the matcher fails to find a match after testing against all the
entries in the list then the path is included.

For example given the following rules, + being include, - being exclude,

    - secret*.jpg
    + *.jpg
    + *.png
    + file2.avi
    - *

This would include

-   file1.jpg
-   file3.png
-   file2.avi

This would exclude

-   secret17.jpg
-   non *.jpg and *.png

A similar process is done on directory entries before recursing into
them. This only works on remotes which have a concept of directory (Eg
local, google drive, onedrive, amazon drive) and not on bucket based
remotes (eg s3, swift, google compute storage, b2).


Adding filtering rules

Filtering rules are added with the following command line flags.

Repeating options

You can repeat the following options to add more than one rule of that
type.

-   --include
-   --include-from
-   --exclude
-   --exclude-from
-   --filter
-   --filter-from

IMPORTANT You should not use --include* together with --exclude*. It may
produce different results than you expected. In that case try to use:
--filter*.

Note that all the options of the same type are processed together in the
order above, regardless of what order they were placed on the command
line.

So all --include options are processed first in the order they appeared
on the command line, then all --include-from options etc.

To mix up the order includes and excludes, the --filter flag can be
used.

--exclude - Exclude files matching pattern

Add a single exclude rule with --exclude.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order the flags are
processed in.

Eg --exclude *.bak to exclude all bak files from the sync.

--exclude-from - Read exclude patterns from file

Add exclude rules from a file.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order the flags are
processed in.

Prepare a file like this exclude-file.txt

    # a sample exclude rule file
    *.bak
    file2.jpg

Then use as --exclude-from exclude-file.txt. This will sync all files
except those ending in bak and file2.jpg.

This is useful if you have a lot of rules.

--include - Include files matching pattern

Add a single include rule with --include.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order the flags are
processed in.

Eg --include *.{png,jpg} to include all png and jpg files in the backup
and no others.

This adds an implicit --exclude * at the very end of the filter list.
This means you can mix --include and --include-from with the other
filters (eg --exclude) but you must include all the files you want in
the include statement. If this doesn’t provide enough flexibility then
you must use --filter-from.

--include-from - Read include patterns from file

Add include rules from a file.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order the flags are
processed in.

Prepare a file like this include-file.txt

    # a sample include rule file
    *.jpg
    *.png
    file2.avi

Then use as --include-from include-file.txt. This will sync all jpg, png
files and file2.avi.

This is useful if you have a lot of rules.

This adds an implicit --exclude * at the very end of the filter list.
This means you can mix --include and --include-from with the other
filters (eg --exclude) but you must include all the files you want in
the include statement. If this doesn’t provide enough flexibility then
you must use --filter-from.

--filter - Add a file-filtering rule

This can be used to add a single include or exclude rule. Include rules
start with + and exclude rules start with -. A special rule called ! can
be used to clear the existing rules.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order the flags are
processed in.

Eg --filter "- *.bak" to exclude all bak files from the sync.

--filter-from - Read filtering patterns from a file

Add include/exclude rules from a file.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order the flags are
processed in.

Prepare a file like this filter-file.txt

    # a sample filter rule file
    - secret*.jpg
    + *.jpg
    + *.png
    + file2.avi
    - /dir/Trash/**
    + /dir/**
    # exclude everything else
    - *

Then use as --filter-from filter-file.txt. The rules are processed in
the order that they are defined.

This example will include all jpg and png files, exclude any files
matching secret*.jpg and include file2.avi. It will also include
everything in the directory dir at the root of the sync, except
dir/Trash which it will exclude. Everything else will be excluded from
the sync.

--files-from - Read list of source-file names

This reads a list of file names from the file passed in and ONLY these
files are transferred. The FILTERING RULES ARE IGNORED completely if you
use this option.

Rclone will traverse the file system if you use --files-from,
effectively using the files in --files-from as a set of filters. Rclone
will not error if any of the files are missing.

If you use --no-traverse as well as --files-from then rclone will not
traverse the destination file system, it will find each file
individually using approximately 1 API call. This can be more efficient
for small lists of files.

This option can be repeated to read from more than one file. These are
read in the order that they are placed on the command line.

Paths within the --files-from file will be interpreted as starting with
the root specified in the command. Leading / characters are ignored.

For example, suppose you had files-from.txt with this content:

    # comment
    file1.jpg
    subdir/file2.jpg

You could then use it like this:

    rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt /home/me/pics remote:pics

This will transfer these files only (if they exist)

    /home/me/pics/file1.jpg        → remote:pics/file1.jpg
    /home/me/pics/subdir/file2.jpg → remote:pics/subdir/file2.jpg

To take a more complicated example, let’s say you had a few files you
want to back up regularly with these absolute paths:

    /home/user1/important
    /home/user1/dir/file
    /home/user2/stuff

To copy these you’d find a common subdirectory - in this case /home and
put the remaining files in files-from.txt with or without leading /, eg

    user1/important
    user1/dir/file
    user2/stuff

You could then copy these to a remote like this

    rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt /home remote:backup

The 3 files will arrive in remote:backup with the paths as in the
files-from.txt like this:

    /home/user1/important → remote:backup/user1/important
    /home/user1/dir/file  → remote:backup/user1/dir/file
    /home/user2/stuff     → remote:backup/user2/stuff

You could of course choose / as the root too in which case your
files-from.txt might look like this.

    /home/user1/important
    /home/user1/dir/file
    /home/user2/stuff

And you would transfer it like this

    rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt / remote:backup

In this case there will be an extra home directory on the remote:

    /home/user1/important → remote:backup/home/user1/important
    /home/user1/dir/file  → remote:backup/home/user1/dir/file
    /home/user2/stuff     → remote:backup/home/user2/stuff

--min-size - Don’t transfer any file smaller than this

This option controls the minimum size file which will be transferred.
This defaults to kBytes but a suffix of k, M, or G can be used.

For example --min-size 50k means no files smaller than 50kByte will be
transferred.

--max-size - Don’t transfer any file larger than this

This option controls the maximum size file which will be transferred.
This defaults to kBytes but a suffix of k, M, or G can be used.

For example --max-size 1G means no files larger than 1GByte will be
transferred.

--max-age - Don’t transfer any file older than this

This option controls the maximum age of files to transfer. Give in
seconds or with a suffix of:

-   ms - Milliseconds
-   s - Seconds
-   m - Minutes
-   h - Hours
-   d - Days
-   w - Weeks
-   M - Months
-   y - Years

For example --max-age 2d means no files older than 2 days will be
transferred.

--min-age - Don’t transfer any file younger than this

This option controls the minimum age of files to transfer. Give in
seconds or with a suffix (see --max-age for list of suffixes)

For example --min-age 2d means no files younger than 2 days will be
transferred.

--delete-excluded - Delete files on dest excluded from sync

IMPORTANT this flag is dangerous - use with --dry-run and -v first.

When doing rclone sync this will delete any files which are excluded
from the sync on the destination.

If for example you did a sync from A to B without the --min-size 50k
flag

    rclone sync A: B:

Then you repeated it like this with the --delete-excluded

    rclone --min-size 50k --delete-excluded sync A: B:

This would delete all files on B which are less than 50 kBytes as these
are now excluded from the sync.

Always test first with --dry-run and -v before using this flag.

--dump filters - dump the filters to the output

This dumps the defined filters to the output as regular expressions.

Useful for debugging.

--ignore-case - make searches case insensitive

Normally filter patterns are case sensitive. If this flag is supplied
then filter patterns become case insensitive.

Normally a --include "file.txt" will not match a file called FILE.txt.
However if you use the --ignore-case flag then --include "file.txt" this
will match a file called FILE.txt.


Quoting shell metacharacters

The examples above may not work verbatim in your shell as they have
shell metacharacters in them (eg *), and may require quoting.

Eg linux, OSX

-   --include \*.jpg
-   --include '*.jpg'
-   --include='*.jpg'

In Windows the expansion is done by the command not the shell so this
should work fine

-   --include *.jpg


Exclude directory based on a file

It is possible to exclude a directory based on a file, which is present
in this directory. Filename should be specified using the
--exclude-if-present flag. This flag has a priority over the other
filtering flags.

Imagine, you have the following directory structure:

    dir1/file1
    dir1/dir2/file2
    dir1/dir2/dir3/file3
    dir1/dir2/dir3/.ignore

You can exclude dir3 from sync by running the following command:

    rclone sync --exclude-if-present .ignore dir1 remote:backup

Currently only one filename is supported, i.e. --exclude-if-present
should not be used multiple times.



GUI (EXPERIMENTAL)


Rclone can serve a web based GUI (graphical user interface). This is
somewhat experimental at the moment so things may be subject to change.

Run this command in a terminal and rclone will download and then display
the GUI in a web browser.

    rclone rcd --rc-web-gui

This will produce logs like this and rclone needs to continue to run to
serve the GUI:

    2019/08/25 11:40:14 NOTICE: A new release for gui is present at https://github.com/rclone/rclone-webui-react/releases/download/v0.0.6/currentbuild.zip
    2019/08/25 11:40:14 NOTICE: Downloading webgui binary. Please wait. [Size: 3813937, Path :  /home/USER/.cache/rclone/webgui/v0.0.6.zip]
    2019/08/25 11:40:16 NOTICE: Unzipping
    2019/08/25 11:40:16 NOTICE: Serving remote control on http://127.0.0.1:5572/

This assumes you are running rclone locally on your machine. It is
possible to separate the rclone and the GUI - see below for details.

If you wish to update to the latest API version then you can add
--rc-web-gui-update to the command line.


Using the GUI

Once the GUI opens, you will be looking at the dashboard which has an
overall overview.

On the left hand side you will see a series of view buttons you can
click on:

-   Dashboard - main overview
-   Configs - examine and create new configurations
-   Explorer - view, download and upload files to the cloud storage
    systems
-   Backend - view or alter the backend config
-   Log out

(More docs and walkthrough video to come!)


How it works

When you run the rclone rcd --rc-web-gui this is what happens

-   Rclone starts but only runs the remote control API (“rc”).
-   The API is bound to localhost with an auto generated username and
    password.
-   If the API bundle is missing then rclone will download it.
-   rclone will start serving the files from the API bundle over the
    same port as the API
-   rclone will open the browser with a login_token so it can log
    straight in.


Advanced use

The rclone rcd may use any of the flags documented on the rc page.

The flag --rc-web-gui is shorthand for

-   Download the web GUI if necessary
-   Check we are using some authentication
-   --rc-user gui
-   --rc-pass <random password>
-   --rc-serve

These flags can be overidden as desired.

See also the rclone rcd documentation.

Example: Running a public GUI

For example the GUI could be served on a public port over SSL using an
htpasswd file using the following flags:

-   --rc-web-gui
-   --rc-addr :443
-   --rc-htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd
-   --rc-cert /path/to/ssl.crt
-   --rc-key /path/to/ssl.key

Example: Running a GUI behind a proxy

If you want to run the GUI behind a proxy at /rclone you could use these
flags:

-   --rc-web-gui
-   --rc-baseurl rclone
-   --rc-htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd

Or instead of htpassword if you just want a single user and password:

-   --rc-user me
-   --rc-pass mypassword


Project

The GUI is being developed in the: rclone/rclone-webui-react
respository.

Bug reports and contributions very welcome welcome :-)

If you have questions then please ask them on the rclone forum.



REMOTE CONTROLLING RCLONE


If rclone is run with the --rc flag then it starts an http server which
can be used to remote control rclone.

If you just want to run a remote control then see the rcd command.

NB this is experimental and everything here is subject to change!


Supported parameters

–rc

Flag to start the http server listen on remote requests

–rc-addr=IP

IPaddress:Port or :Port to bind server to. (default “localhost:5572”)

–rc-cert=KEY

SSL PEM key (concatenation of certificate and CA certificate)

–rc-client-ca=PATH

Client certificate authority to verify clients with

–rc-htpasswd=PATH

htpasswd file - if not provided no authentication is done

–rc-key=PATH

SSL PEM Private key

–rc-max-header-bytes=VALUE

Maximum size of request header (default 4096)

–rc-user=VALUE

User name for authentication.

–rc-pass=VALUE

Password for authentication.

–rc-realm=VALUE

Realm for authentication (default “rclone”)

–rc-server-read-timeout=DURATION

Timeout for server reading data (default 1h0m0s)

–rc-server-write-timeout=DURATION

Timeout for server writing data (default 1h0m0s)

–rc-serve

Enable the serving of remote objects via the HTTP interface. This means
objects will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5572/ by default, so you
can browse to http://127.0.0.1:5572/ or http://127.0.0.1:5572/* to see a
listing of the remotes. Objects may be requested from remotes using this
syntax http://127.0.0.1:5572/[remote:path]/path/to/object

Default Off.

–rc-files /path/to/directory

Path to local files to serve on the HTTP server.

If this is set then rclone will serve the files in that directory. It
will also open the root in the web browser if specified. This is for
implementing browser based GUIs for rclone functions.

If --rc-user or --rc-pass is set then the URL that is opened will have
the authorization in the URL in the http://user:pass@localhost/ style.

Default Off.

–rc-web-gui

Set this flag to serve the default web gui on the same port as rclone.

Default Off.

–rc-allow-origin

Set the allowed Access-Control-Allow-Origin for rc requests.

Can be used with –rc-web-gui if the rclone is running on different IP
than the web-gui.

Default is IP address on which rc is running.

–rc-web-fetch-url

Set the URL to fetch the rclone-web-gui files from.

Default
https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone-webui-react/releases/latest.

–rc-web-gui-update

Set this flag to Download / Force update rclone-webui-react from the
rc-web-fetch-url.

Default Off.

–rc-job-expire-duration=DURATION

Expire finished async jobs older than DURATION (default 60s).

–rc-job-expire-interval=DURATION

Interval duration to check for expired async jobs (default 10s).

–rc-no-auth

By default rclone will require authorisation to have been set up on the
rc interface in order to use any methods which access any rclone
remotes. Eg operations/list is denied as it involved creating a remote
as is sync/copy.

If this is set then no authorisation will be required on the server to
use these methods. The alternative is to use --rc-user and --rc-pass and
use these credentials in the request.

Default Off.


Accessing the remote control via the rclone rc command

Rclone itself implements the remote control protocol in its rclone rc
command.

You can use it like this

    $ rclone rc rc/noop param1=one param2=two
    {
        "param1": "one",
        "param2": "two"
    }

Run rclone rc on its own to see the help for the installed remote
control commands.

rclone rc also supports a --json flag which can be used to send more
complicated input parameters.

    $ rclone rc --json '{ "p1": [1,"2",null,4], "p2": { "a":1, "b":2 } }' rc/noop
    {
        "p1": [
            1,
            "2",
            null,
            4
        ],
        "p2": {
            "a": 1,
            "b": 2
        }
    }


Special parameters

The rc interface supports some special parameters which apply to ALL
commands. These start with _ to show they are different.

Running asynchronous jobs with _async = true

Each rc call is classified as a job and it is assigned its own id. By
default jobs are executed immediately as they are created or
synchronously.

If _async has a true value when supplied to an rc call then it will
return immediately with a job id and the task will be run in the
background. The job/status call can be used to get information of the
background job. The job can be queried for up to 1 minute after it has
finished.

It is recommended that potentially long running jobs, eg sync/sync,
sync/copy, sync/move, operations/purge are run with the _async flag to
avoid any potential problems with the HTTP request and response timing
out.

Starting a job with the _async flag:

    $ rclone rc --json '{ "p1": [1,"2",null,4], "p2": { "a":1, "b":2 }, "_async": true }' rc/noop
    {
        "jobid": 2
    }

Query the status to see if the job has finished. For more information on
the meaning of these return parameters see the job/status call.

    $ rclone rc --json '{ "jobid":2 }' job/status
    {
        "duration": 0.000124163,
        "endTime": "2018-10-27T11:38:07.911245881+01:00",
        "error": "",
        "finished": true,
        "id": 2,
        "output": {
            "_async": true,
            "p1": [
                1,
                "2",
                null,
                4
            ],
            "p2": {
                "a": 1,
                "b": 2
            }
        },
        "startTime": "2018-10-27T11:38:07.911121728+01:00",
        "success": true
    }

job/list can be used to show the running or recently completed jobs

    $ rclone rc job/list
    {
        "jobids": [
            2
        ]
    }

Assigning operations to groups with _group = 

Each rc call has it’s own stats group for tracking it’s metrics. By
default grouping is done by the composite group name from prefix job/
and id of the job like so job/1.

If _group has a value then stats for that request will be grouped under
that value. This allows caller to group stats under their own name.

Stats for specific group can be accessed by passing group to core/stats:

    $ rclone rc --json '{ "group": "job/1" }' core/stats
    {
        "speed": 12345
        ...
    }


Supported commands

cache/expire: Purge a remote from cache {#cache/expire}

Purge a remote from the cache backend. Supports either a directory or a
file. Params: - remote = path to remote (required) - withData =
true/false to delete cached data (chunks) as well (optional)

Eg

    rclone rc cache/expire remote=path/to/sub/folder/
    rclone rc cache/expire remote=/ withData=true

cache/fetch: Fetch file chunks {#cache/fetch}

Ensure the specified file chunks are cached on disk.

The chunks= parameter specifies the file chunks to check. It takes a
comma separated list of array slice indices. The slice indices are
similar to Python slices: start[:end]

start is the 0 based chunk number from the beginning of the file to
fetch inclusive. end is 0 based chunk number from the beginning of the
file to fetch exclusive. Both values can be negative, in which case they
count from the back of the file. The value “-5:” represents the last 5
chunks of a file.

Some valid examples are: “:5,-5:” -> the first and last five chunks
“0,-2” -> the first and the second last chunk “0:10” -> the first ten
chunks

Any parameter with a key that starts with “file” can be used to specify
files to fetch, eg

    rclone rc cache/fetch chunks=0 file=hello file2=home/goodbye

File names will automatically be encrypted when the a crypt remote is
used on top of the cache.

cache/stats: Get cache stats {#cache/stats}

Show statistics for the cache remote.

config/create: create the config for a remote. {#config/create}

This takes the following parameters

-   name - name of remote
-   parameters - a map of { “key”: “value” } pairs
-   type - type of the new remote

See the config create command command for more information on the above.

Authentication is required for this call.

config/delete: Delete a remote in the config file. {#config/delete}

Parameters:

-   name - name of remote to delete

See the config delete command command for more information on the above.

Authentication is required for this call.

config/dump: Dumps the config file. {#config/dump}

Returns a JSON object: - key: value

Where keys are remote names and values are the config parameters.

See the config dump command command for more information on the above.

Authentication is required for this call.

config/get: Get a remote in the config file. {#config/get}

Parameters:

-   name - name of remote to get

See the config dump command command for more information on the above.

Authentication is required for this call.

config/listremotes: Lists the remotes in the config file. {#config/listremotes}

Returns - remotes - array of remote names

See the listremotes command command for more information on the above.

Authentication is required for this call.

config/password: password the config for a remote. {#config/password}

This takes the following parameters

-   name - name of remote
-   parameters - a map of { “key”: “value” } pairs

See the config password command command for more information on the
above.

Authentication is required for this call.

config/providers: Shows how providers are configured in the config file. {#config/providers}

Returns a JSON object: - providers - array of objects

See the config providers command command for more information on the
above.

Authentication is required for this call.

config/update: update the config for a remote. {#config/update}

This takes the following parameters

-   name - name of remote
-   parameters - a map of { “key”: “value” } pairs

See the config update command command for more information on the above.

Authentication is required for this call.

core/bwlimit: Set the bandwidth limit. {#core/bwlimit}

This sets the bandwidth limit to that passed in.

Eg

    rclone rc core/bwlimit rate=off
    {
        "bytesPerSecond": -1,
        "rate": "off"
    }
    rclone rc core/bwlimit rate=1M
    {
        "bytesPerSecond": 1048576,
        "rate": "1M"
    }

If the rate parameter is not suppied then the bandwidth is queried

    rclone rc core/bwlimit
    {
        "bytesPerSecond": 1048576,
        "rate": "1M"
    }

The format of the parameter is exactly the same as passed to –bwlimit
except only one bandwidth may be specified.

In either case “rate” is returned as a human readable string, and
“bytesPerSecond” is returned as a number.

core/gc: Runs a garbage collection. {#core/gc}

This tells the go runtime to do a garbage collection run. It isn’t
necessary to call this normally, but it can be useful for debugging
memory problems.

core/group-list: Returns list of stats. {#core/group-list}

This returns list of stats groups currently in memory.

Returns the following values:

    {
        "groups":  an array of group names:
            [
                "group1",
                "group2",
                ...
            ]
    }

core/memstats: Returns the memory statistics {#core/memstats}

This returns the memory statistics of the running program. What the
values mean are explained in the go docs:
https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#MemStats

The most interesting values for most people are:

-   HeapAlloc: This is the amount of memory rclone is actually using
-   HeapSys: This is the amount of memory rclone has obtained from the
    OS
-   Sys: this is the total amount of memory requested from the OS
    -   It is virtual memory so may include unused memory

core/obscure: Obscures a string passed in. {#core/obscure}

Pass a clear string and rclone will obscure it for the config file: -
clear - string

Returns - obscured - string

core/pid: Return PID of current process {#core/pid}

This returns PID of current process. Useful for stopping rclone process.

core/quit: Terminates the app. {#core/quit}

(optional) Pass an exit code to be used for terminating the app: -
exitCode - int

core/stats: Returns stats about current transfers. {#core/stats}

This returns all available stats:

    rclone rc core/stats

If group is not provided then summed up stats for all groups will be
returned.

Parameters

-   group - name of the stats group (string)

Returns the following values:

    {
        "speed": average speed in bytes/sec since start of the process,
        "bytes": total transferred bytes since the start of the process,
        "errors": number of errors,

        "checks": number of checked files,
        "transfers": number of transferred files,
        "deletes" : number of deleted files,
        "elapsedTime": time in seconds since the start of the process,
        "lastError": last occurred error,
        "transferring": an array of currently active file transfers:
            [
                {
                    "bytes": total transferred bytes for this file,
                    "eta": estimated time in seconds until file transfer completion
                    "name": name of the file,
                    "percentage": progress of the file transfer in percent,
                    "speed": speed in bytes/sec,
                    "speedAvg": speed in bytes/sec as an exponentially weighted moving average,
                    "size": size of the file in bytes
                }
            ],
        "checking": an array of names of currently active file checks
            []
    }

Values for “transferring”, “checking” and “lastError” are only assigned
if data is available. The value for “eta” is null if an eta cannot be
determined.

core/stats-reset: Reset stats. {#core/stats-reset}

This clears counters and errors for all stats or specific stats group if
group is provided.

Parameters

-   group - name of the stats group (string)

core/transferred: Returns stats about completed transfers. {#core/transferred}

This returns stats about completed transfers:

    rclone rc core/transferred

If group is not provided then completed transfers for all groups will be
returned.

Note only the last 100 completed transfers are returned.

Parameters

-   group - name of the stats group (string)

Returns the following values:

    {
        "transferred":  an array of completed transfers (including failed ones):

Parameters

-   option block name containing an object with
    -   key: value

Repeated as often as required.

Only supply the options you wish to change. If an option is unknown it
will be silently ignored. Not all options will have an effect when
changed like this.

For example:

This sets DEBUG level logs (-vv)

    rclone rc options/set --json '{"main": {"LogLevel": 8}}'

And this sets INFO level logs (-v)

This takes the following parameters

-   srcFs - a remote name string eg “drive:src” for the source
-   dstFs - a remote name string eg “drive:dst” for the destination

See the sync command command for more information on the above.

Authentication is required for this call.

vfs/forget: Forget files or directories in the directory cache. {#vfs/forget}

This forgets the paths in the directory cache causing them to be re-read
from the remote when needed.

If no paths are passed in then it will forget all the paths in the
directory cache.

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Otherwise pass files or dirs in as file=path or dir=path. Any parameter
key starting with file will forget that file and any starting with dir
will forget that dir, eg

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=hello file2=goodbye dir=home/junk

vfs/poll-interval: Get the status or update the value of the poll-interval option. {#vfs/poll-interval}

Without any parameter given this returns the current status of the
poll-interval setting.

When the interval=duration parameter is set, the poll-interval value is
updated and the polling function is notified. Setting interval=0
disables poll-interval.

    rclone rc vfs/poll-interval interval=5m

The timeout=duration parameter can be used to specify a time to wait for
the current poll function to apply the new value. If timeout is less or
equal 0, which is the default, wait indefinitely.

The new poll-interval value will only be active when the timeout is not
reached.

If poll-interval is updated or disabled temporarily, some changes might
not get picked up by the polling function, depending on the used remote.

vfs/refresh: Refresh the directory cache. {#vfs/refresh}

This reads the directories for the specified paths and freshens the
directory cache.

If no paths are passed in then it will refresh the root directory.

    rclone rc vfs/refresh

Otherwise pass directories in as dir=path. Any parameter key starting
with dir will refresh that directory, eg

    rclone rc vfs/refresh dir=home/junk dir2=data/misc

If the parameter recursive=true is given the whole directory tree will
get refreshed. This refresh will use –fast-list if enabled.


Accessing the remote control via HTTP

Rclone implements a simple HTTP based protocol.

Each endpoint takes an JSON object and returns a JSON object or an
error. The JSON objects are essentially a map of string names to values.

All calls must made using POST.

The input objects can be supplied using URL parameters, POST parameters
or by supplying “Content-Type: application/json” and a JSON blob in the
body. There are examples of these below using curl.

The response will be a JSON blob in the body of the response. This is
formatted to be reasonably human readable.

Error returns

If an error occurs then there will be an HTTP error status (eg 500) and
the body of the response will contain a JSON encoded error object, eg

    {
        "error": "Expecting string value for key \"remote\" (was float64)",
        "input": {
            "fs": "/tmp",
            "remote": 3
        },
        "status": 400
        "path": "operations/rmdir",
    }

The keys in the error response are - error - error string - input - the
input parameters to the call - status - the HTTP status code - path -
the path of the call

CORS

The sever implements basic CORS support and allows all origins for that.
The response to a preflight OPTIONS request will echo the requested
“Access-Control-Request-Headers” back.

Using POST with URL parameters only

    curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5572/rc/noop?potato=1&sausage=2'

Response

    {
        "potato": "1",
        "sausage": "2"
    }

Here is what an error response looks like:

    curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5572/rc/error?potato=1&sausage=2'

    {
        "error": "arbitrary error on input map[potato:1 sausage:2]",
        "input": {
            "potato": "1",
            "sausage": "2"
        }
    }

Note that curl doesn’t return errors to the shell unless you use the -f
option

    $ curl -f -X POST 'http://localhost:5572/rc/error?potato=1&sausage=2'
    curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 400 Bad Request
    $ echo $?
    22

Using POST with a form

    curl --data "potato=1" --data "sausage=2" http://localhost:5572/rc/noop

Response

    {
        "potato": "1",
        "sausage": "2"
    }

Note that you can combine these with URL parameters too with the POST
parameters taking precedence.

    curl --data "potato=1" --data "sausage=2" "http://localhost:5572/rc/noop?rutabaga=3&sausage=4"

Response

    {
        "potato": "1",
        "rutabaga": "3",
        "sausage": "4"
    }

Using POST with a JSON blob

    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"potato":2,"sausage":1}' http://localhost:5572/rc/noop

response

    {
        "password": "xyz",
        "username": "xyz"
    }

This can be combined with URL parameters too if required. The JSON blob
takes precedence.

    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"potato":2,"sausage":1}' 'http://localhost:5572/rc/noop?rutabaga=3&potato=4'

    {
        "potato": 2,
        "rutabaga": "3",
        "sausage": 1
    }


Debugging rclone with pprof

If you use the --rc flag this will also enable the use of the go
profiling tools on the same port.

To use these, first install go.

Debugging memory use

To profile rclone’s memory use you can run:

    go tool pprof -web http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/heap

This should open a page in your browser showing what is using what
memory.

You can also use the -text flag to produce a textual summary

    $ go tool pprof -text http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/heap

Debugging go routine leaks

Memory leaks are most often caused by go routine leaks keeping memory
alive which should have been garbage collected.

See all active go routines using

    curl http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1

Or go to http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1 in your
browser.

Other profiles to look at

You can see a summary of profiles available at
http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/

Here is how to use some of them:

-   Memory: go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/heap
-   Go routines:
    curl http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1
-   30-second CPU profile:
    go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/profile
-   5-second execution trace:
    wget http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/trace?seconds=5

See the net/http/pprof docs for more info on how to use the profiling
and for a general overview see the Go team’s blog post on profiling go
programs.

The profiling hook is zero overhead unless it is used.



OVERVIEW OF CLOUD STORAGE SYSTEMS

Hash

The cloud storage system supports various hash types of the objects. The
hashes are used when transferring data as an integrity check and can be
specifically used with the --checksum flag in syncs and in the check
command.

To use the verify checksums when transferring between cloud storage
systems they must support a common hash type.

† Note that Dropbox supports its own custom hash. This is an SHA256 sum
of all the 4MB block SHA256s.

‡ SFTP supports checksums if the same login has shell access and md5sum
or sha1sum as well as echo are in the remote’s PATH.

†† WebDAV supports hashes when used with Owncloud and Nextcloud only.

††† WebDAV supports modtimes when used with Owncloud and Nextcloud only.

‡‡ Microsoft OneDrive Personal supports SHA1 hashes, whereas OneDrive
for business and SharePoint server support Microsoft’s own QuickXorHash.

‡‡‡ Mail.ru uses its own modified SHA1 hash

ModTime

The cloud storage system supports setting modification times on objects.
If it does then this enables a using the modification times as part of
the sync. If not then only the size will be checked by default, though
the MD5SUM can be checked with the --checksum flag.

All cloud storage systems support some kind of date on the object and
these will be set when transferring from the cloud storage system.

Case Insensitive

If a cloud storage systems is case sensitive then it is possible to have
two files which differ only in case, eg file.txt and FILE.txt. If a
cloud storage system is case insensitive then that isn’t possible.

This can cause problems when syncing between a case insensitive system
and a case sensitive system. The symptom of this is that no matter how
many times you run the sync it never completes fully.

The local filesystem and SFTP may or may not be case sensitive depending
on OS.

-   Windows - usually case insensitive, though case is preserved
-   OSX - usually case insensitive, though it is possible to format case
    sensitive
-   Linux - usually case sensitive, but there are case insensitive file
    systems (eg FAT formatted USB keys)

Most of the time this doesn’t cause any problems as people tend to avoid
files whose name differs only by case even on case sensitive systems.

Duplicate files

If a cloud storage system allows duplicate files then it can have two
objects with the same name.

This confuses rclone greatly when syncing - use the rclone dedupe
command to rename or remove duplicates.

Restricted filenames

Some cloud storage systems might have restrictions on the characters
that are usable in file or directory names. When rclone detects such a
name during a file upload, it will transparently replace the restricted
characters with similar looking Unicode characters.

This process is designed to avoid ambiguous file names as much as
possible and allow to move files between many cloud storage systems
transparently.

The name shown by rclone to the user or during log output will only
contain a minimal set of replaced characters to ensure correct
formatting and not necessarily the actual name used on the cloud
storage.

This transformation is reversed when downloading a file or parsing
rclone arguments. For example, when uploading a file named my file?.txt
to Onedrive will be displayed as my file?.txt on the console, but stored
as my file？.txt (the ? gets replaced by the similar looking ？
character) to Onedrive. The reverse transformation allows to read a
fileunusual/name.txt from Google Drive, by passing the name
unusual／name.txt (the / needs to be replaced by the similar looking ／
character) on the command line.

Default restricted characters

The table below shows the characters that are replaced by default.

When a replacement character is found in a filename, this character will
be escaped with the ‛ character to avoid ambiguous file names. (e.g. a
file named ␀.txt would shown as ‛␀.txt)

Each cloud storage backend can use a different set of characters, which
will be specified in the documentation for each backend.

The default encoding will also encode these file names as they are
problematic with many cloud storage systems.

  File name    Replacement

  ..              ．．

Invalid UTF-8 bytes

Some backends only support a sequence of well formed UTF-8 bytes as file
or directory names.

In this case all invalid UTF-8 bytes will be replaced with a quoted
representation of the byte value to allow uploading a file to such a
backend. For example, the invalid byte 0xFE will be encoded as ‛FE.

A common source of invalid UTF-8 bytes are local filesystems, that store
names in a different encoding than UTF-8 or UTF-16, like latin1. See the
local filenames section for details.

MIME Type

MIME types (also known as media types) classify types of documents using
a simple text classification, eg text/html or application/pdf.

Some cloud storage systems support reading (R) the MIME type of objects
and some support writing (W) the MIME type of objects.

The MIME type can be important if you are serving files directly to HTTP
from the storage system.

If you are copying from a remote which supports reading (R) to a remote
which supports writing (W) then rclone will preserve the MIME types.
Otherwise they will be guessed from the extension, or the remote itself
may assign the MIME type.


Optional Features

All the remotes support a basic set of features, but there are some
optional features supported by some remotes used to make some operations
more efficient.

Purge

This deletes a directory quicker than just deleting all the files in the
directory.

† Note Swift and Hubic implement this in order to delete directory
markers but they don’t actually have a quicker way of deleting files
other than deleting them individually.

‡ StreamUpload is not supported with Nextcloud

Copy

Used when copying an object to and from the same remote. This known as a
server side copy so you can copy a file without downloading it and
uploading it again. It is used if you use rclone copy or rclone move if
the remote doesn’t support Move directly.

If the server doesn’t support Copy directly then for copy operations the
file is downloaded then re-uploaded.

Move

Used when moving/renaming an object on the same remote. This is known as
a server side move of a file. This is used in rclone move if the server
doesn’t support DirMove.

If the server isn’t capable of Move then rclone simulates it with Copy
then delete. If the server doesn’t support Copy then rclone will
download the file and re-upload it.

DirMove

This is used to implement rclone move to move a directory if possible.
If it isn’t then it will use Move on each file (which falls back to Copy
then download and upload - see Move section).

CleanUp

This is used for emptying the trash for a remote by rclone cleanup.

If the server can’t do CleanUp then rclone cleanup will return an error.

ListR

The remote supports a recursive list to list all the contents beneath a
directory quickly. This enables the --fast-list flag to work. See the
rclone docs for more details.

StreamUpload

Some remotes allow files to be uploaded without knowing the file size in
advance. This allows certain operations to work without spooling the
file to local disk first, e.g. rclone rcat.

LinkSharing

Sets the necessary permissions on a file or folder and prints a link
that allows others to access them, even if they don’t have an account on
the particular cloud provider.

About

This is used to fetch quota information from the remote, like bytes
used/free/quota and bytes used in the trash.

This is also used to return the space used, available for rclone mount.

If the server can’t do About then rclone about will return an error.

EmptyDir

The remote supports empty directories. See Limitations for details. Most
Object/Bucket based remotes do not support this.

1Fichier

This is a backend for the 1ficher cloud storage service. Note that a
Premium subscription is required to use the API.

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, eg remote:directory/subdirectory.

The initial setup for 1Fichier involves getting the API key from the
website which you need to do in your browser.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / 1Fichier
       \ "fichier"
    [snip]
    Storage> fichier
    ** See help for fichier backend at: https://rclone.org/fichier/ **

    Your API Key, get it from https://1fichier.com/console/params.pl
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    api_key> example_key

    Edit advanced config? (y/n)
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> 
    Remote config
    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = fichier
    api_key = example_key
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your 1Fichier account

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your 1Fichier account

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a 1Fichier directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Modified time and hashes

1Fichier does not support modification times. It supports the Whirlpool
hash algorithm.

Duplicated files

1Fichier can have two files with exactly the same name and path (unlike
a normal file system).

Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  \            0x5C        ＼
  <            0x3C        ＜
  >            0x3E        ＞
  "            0x22        ＂
  $            0x24        ＄
  `            0x60        ｀
  ’            0x27        ＇

File names can also not start or end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are first or last character in the name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  SP           0x20         ␠

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in JSON
strings.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to fichier (1Fichier).

–fichier-api-key

Your API Key, get it from https://1fichier.com/console/params.pl

-   Config: api_key
-   Env Var: RCLONE_FICHIER_API_KEY
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to fichier (1Fichier).

–fichier-shared-folder

If you want to download a shared folder, add this parameter

-   Config: shared_folder
-   Env Var: RCLONE_FICHIER_SHARED_FOLDER
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""


Alias

The alias remote provides a new name for another remote.

Paths may be as deep as required or a local path, eg
remote:directory/subdirectory or /directory/subdirectory.

During the initial setup with rclone config you will specify the target
remote. The target remote can either be a local path or another remote.

Subfolders can be used in target remote. Assume a alias remote named
backup with the target mydrive:private/backup. Invoking
rclone mkdir backup:desktop is exactly the same as invoking
rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/desktop.

There will be no special handling of paths containing .. segments.
Invoking rclone mkdir backup:../desktop is exactly the same as invoking
rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/../desktop. The empty path is not
allowed as a remote. To alias the current directory use . instead.

Here is an example of how to make a alias called remote for local
folder. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Alias for an existing remote
       \ "alias"
    [snip]
    Storage> alias
    Remote or path to alias.
    Can be "myremote:path/to/dir", "myremote:bucket", "myremote:" or "/local/path".
    remote> /mnt/storage/backup
    Remote config
    --------------------
    [remote]
    remote = /mnt/storage/backup
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote

    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level in /mnt/storage/backup

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in /mnt/storage/backup

    rclone ls remote:

Copy another local directory to the alias directory called source

    rclone copy /home/source remote:source

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to alias (Alias for an existing
remote).

–alias-remote

Remote or path to alias. Can be “myremote:path/to/dir”,
“myremote:bucket”, “myremote:” or “/local/path”.

Amazon Drive

Amazon Drive, formerly known as Amazon Cloud Drive, is a cloud storage
service run by Amazon for consumers.


Status

IMPORTANT: rclone supports Amazon Drive only if you have your own set of
API keys. Unfortunately the Amazon Drive developer program is now closed
to new entries so if you don’t already have your own set of keys you
will not be able to use rclone with Amazon Drive.

For the history on why rclone no longer has a set of Amazon Drive API
keys see the forum.

If you happen to know anyone who works at Amazon then please ask them to
re-instate rclone into the Amazon Drive developer program - thanks!


Setup

The initial setup for Amazon Drive involves getting a token from Amazon
which you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks you through
it.

The configuration process for Amazon Drive may involve using an oauth
proxy. This is used to keep the Amazon credentials out of the source
code. The proxy runs in Google’s very secure App Engine environment and
doesn’t store any credentials which pass through it.

Since rclone doesn’t currently have its own Amazon Drive credentials so
you will either need to have your own client_id and client_secret with
Amazon Drive, or use a a third party ouath proxy in which case you will
need to enter client_id, client_secret, auth_url and token_url.

Note also if you are not using Amazon’s auth_url and token_url, (ie you
filled in something for those) then if setting up on a remote machine
you can only use the copying the config method of configuration -
rclone authorize will not work.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/r/c/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Amazon Drive
       \ "amazon cloud drive"
    [snip]
    Storage> amazon cloud drive
    Amazon Application Client Id - required.

     * Say Y if not sure
     * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> y
    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    --------------------
    [remote]
    client_id = your client ID goes here
    client_secret = your client secret goes here
    auth_url = Optional auth URL
    token_url = Optional token URL
    token = {"access_token":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","expiry":"2015-09-06T16:07:39.658438471+01:00"}
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

See the remote setup docs for how to set it up on a machine with no
Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Amazon. This only runs from the moment it opens
your browser to the moment you get back the verification code. This is
on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it may require you to unblock it
temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your Amazon Drive

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Amazon Drive

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Amazon Drive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Modified time and MD5SUMs

Amazon Drive doesn’t allow modification times to be changed via the API
so these won’t be accurate or used for syncing.

It does store MD5SUMs so for a more accurate sync, you can use the
--checksum flag.

Restricted filename characters

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  NUL          0x00         ␀
  /            0x2F        ／

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in JSON
strings.

Deleting files

Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash. Amazon don’t
provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to empty the trash, so
you will have to do that with one of Amazon’s apps or via the Amazon
Drive website. As of November 17, 2016, files are automatically deleted
by Amazon from the trash after 30 days.

Using with non .com Amazon accounts

Let’s say you usually use amazon.co.uk. When you authenticate with
rclone it will take you to an amazon.com page to log in. Your
amazon.co.uk email and password should work here just fine.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to amazon cloud drive (Amazon
Drive).

–acd-client-id

Amazon Application Client ID.

-   Config: client_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ACD_CLIENT_ID
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–acd-client-secret

Amazon Application Client Secret.

-   Config: client_secret
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ACD_CLIENT_SECRET
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to amazon cloud drive (Amazon
Drive).

–acd-auth-url

Auth server URL. Leave blank to use Amazon’s.

-   Config: auth_url
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ACD_AUTH_URL
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–acd-token-url

Token server url. leave blank to use Amazon’s.

-   Config: token_url
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ACD_TOKEN_URL
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–acd-checkpoint

Checkpoint for internal polling (debug).

-   Config: checkpoint
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ACD_CHECKPOINT
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–acd-upload-wait-per-gb

Additional time per GB to wait after a failed complete upload to see if
it appears.

Sometimes Amazon Drive gives an error when a file has been fully
uploaded but the file appears anyway after a little while. This happens
sometimes for files over 1GB in size and nearly every time for files
bigger than 10GB. This parameter controls the time rclone waits for the
file to appear.

The default value for this parameter is 3 minutes per GB, so by default
it will wait 3 minutes for every GB uploaded to see if the file appears.

You can disable this feature by setting it to 0. This may cause conflict
errors as rclone retries the failed upload but the file will most likely
appear correctly eventually.

These values were determined empirically by observing lots of uploads of
big files for a range of file sizes.

Upload with the “-v” flag to see more info about what rclone is doing in
this situation.

-   Config: upload_wait_per_gb
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ACD_UPLOAD_WAIT_PER_GB
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 3m0s

–acd-templink-threshold

Files >= this size will be downloaded via their tempLink.

Files this size or more will be downloaded via their “tempLink”. This is
to work around a problem with Amazon Drive which blocks downloads of
files bigger than about 10GB. The default for this is 9GB which
shouldn’t need to be changed.

To download files above this threshold, rclone requests a “tempLink”
which downloads the file through a temporary URL directly from the
underlying S3 storage.

-   Config: templink_threshold
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ACD_TEMPLINK_THRESHOLD
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 9G

Limitations

Note that Amazon Drive is case insensitive so you can’t have a file
called “Hello.doc” and one called “hello.doc”.

Amazon Drive has rate limiting so you may notice errors in the sync (429
errors). rclone will automatically retry the sync up to 3 times by
default (see --retries flag) which should hopefully work around this
problem.

Amazon Drive has an internal limit of file sizes that can be uploaded to
the service. This limit is not officially published, but all files
larger than this will fail.

At the time of writing (Jan 2016) is in the area of 50GB per file. This
means that larger files are likely to fail.

Unfortunately there is no way for rclone to see that this failure is
because of file size, so it will retry the operation, as any other
failure. To avoid this problem, use --max-size 50000M option to limit
the maximum size of uploaded files. Note that --max-size does not split
files into segments, it only ignores files over this size.


Amazon S3 Storage Providers

The S3 backend can be used with a number of different providers:

-   AWS S3
-   Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun) Object Storage System (OSS)
-   Ceph
-   DigitalOcean Spaces
-   Dreamhost
-   IBM COS S3
-   Minio
-   Wasabi

Paths are specified as remote:bucket (or remote: for the lsd command.)
You may put subdirectories in too, eg remote:bucket/path/to/dir.

Once you have made a remote (see the provider specific section above)
you can use it like this:

See all buckets

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote bucket, deleting any excess
files in the bucket.

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:bucket

–fast-list

This remote supports --fast-list which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the rclone docs for more
details.

–update and –use-server-modtime

As noted below, the modified time is stored on metadata on the object.
It is used by default for all operations that require checking the time
a file was last updated. It allows rclone to treat the remote more like
a true filesystem, but it is inefficient because it requires an extra
API call to retrieve the metadata.

For many operations, the time the object was last uploaded to the remote
is sufficient to determine if it is “dirty”. By using --update along
with --use-server-modtime, you can avoid the extra API call and simply
upload files whose local modtime is newer than the time it was last
uploaded.

Modified time

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
X-Amz-Meta-Mtime as floating point since the epoch accurate to 1 ns.

If the modification time needs to be updated rclone will attempt to
perform a server side copy to update the modification if the object can
be copied in a single part.
In the case the object is larger than 5Gb or is in Glacier or Glacier
Deep Archive storage the object will be uploaded rather than copied.

Restricted filename characters

S3 allows any valid UTF-8 string as a key.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will be replaced, as they can’t be used in XML.

The following characters are replaced since these are problematic when
dealing with the REST API:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  NUL          0x00         ␀
  /            0x2F        ／

The encoding will also encode these file names as they don’t seem to
work with the SDK properly:

  File name    Replacement
  ----------- -------------
  .                ．
  ..              ．．

Multipart uploads

rclone supports multipart uploads with S3 which means that it can upload
files bigger than 5GB.

Note that files uploaded _both_ with multipart upload _and_ through
crypt remotes do not have MD5 sums.

rclone switches from single part uploads to multipart uploads at the
point specified by --s3-upload-cutoff. This can be a maximum of 5GB and
a minimum of 0 (ie always upload multipart files).

The chunk sizes used in the multipart upload are specified by
--s3-chunk-size and the number of chunks uploaded concurrently is
specified by --s3-upload-concurrency.

Multipart uploads will use --transfers * --s3-upload-concurrency *
--s3-chunk-size extra memory. Single part uploads to not use extra
memory.

Single part transfers can be faster than multipart transfers or slower
depending on your latency from S3 - the more latency, the more likely
single part transfers will be faster.

Increasing --s3-upload-concurrency will increase throughput (8 would be
a sensible value) and increasing --s3-chunk-size also increases
throughput (16M would be sensible). Increasing either of these will use
more memory. The default values are high enough to gain most of the
possible performance without using too much memory.

Buckets and Regions

With Amazon S3 you can list buckets (rclone lsd) using any region, but
you can only access the content of a bucket from the region it was
created in. If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong region, you
will get an error, incorrect region, the bucket is not in 'XXX' region.

Authentication

There are a number of ways to supply rclone with a set of AWS
credentials, with and without using the environment.

The different authentication methods are tried in this order:

-   Directly in the rclone configuration file (env_auth = false in the
    config file):
    -   access_key_id and secret_access_key are required.
    -   session_token can be optionally set when using AWS STS.
-   Runtime configuration (env_auth = true in the config file):
    -   Export the following environment variables before running
        rclone:
        -   Access Key ID: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID or AWS_ACCESS_KEY
        -   Secret Access Key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY or AWS_SECRET_KEY
        -   Session Token: AWS_SESSION_TOKEN (optional)
    -   Or, use a named profile:
        -   Profile files are standard files used by AWS CLI tools
        -   By default it will use the profile in your home directory
            (eg ~/.aws/credentials on unix based systems) file and the
            “default” profile, to change set these environment
            variables:
            -   AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE to control which file.
            -   AWS_PROFILE to control which profile to use.
    -   Or, run rclone in an ECS task with an IAM role (AWS only).
    -   Or, run rclone on an EC2 instance with an IAM role (AWS only).

If none of these option actually end up providing rclone with AWS
credentials then S3 interaction will be non-authenticated (see below).

S3 Permissions

When using the sync subcommand of rclone the following minimum
permissions are required to be available on the bucket being written to:

-   ListBucket
-   DeleteObject
-   GetObject
-   PutObject
-   PutObjectACL

When using the lsd subcommand, the ListAllMyBuckets permission is
required.

Example policy:

    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::USER_SID:user/USER_NAME"
                },
                "Action": [
                    "s3:ListBucket",
                    "s3:DeleteObject",
                    "s3:GetObject",
                    "s3:PutObject",
                    "s3:PutObjectAcl"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                  "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*",
                  "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME"
                ]
            },
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*"
            }   
        ]
    }

Notes on above:

1.  This is a policy that can be used when creating bucket. It assumes
    that USER_NAME has been created.
2.  The Resource entry must include both resource ARNs, as one implies
    the bucket and the other implies the bucket’s objects.

For reference, here’s an Ansible script that will generate one or more
buckets that will work with rclone sync.

Key Management System (KMS)

If you are using server side encryption with KMS then you will find you
can’t transfer small objects. As a work-around you can use the
--ignore-checksum flag.

A proper fix is being worked on in issue #1824.

Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive

You can upload objects using the glacier storage class or transition
them to glacier using a lifecycle policy. The bucket can still be synced
or copied into normally, but if rclone tries to access data from the
glacier storage class you will see an error like below.

    2017/09/11 19:07:43 Failed to sync: failed to open source object: Object in GLACIER, restore first: path/to/file

In this case you need to restore the object(s) in question before using
rclone.

Note that rclone only speaks the S3 API it does not speak the Glacier
Vault API, so rclone cannot directly access Glacier Vaults.

–s3-acl

Canned ACL used when creating buckets and storing or copying objects.

This ACL is used for creating objects and if bucket_acl isn’t set, for
creating buckets too.

For more info visit
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl

Note that this ACL is applied when server side copying objects as S3
doesn’t copy the ACL from the source but rather writes a fresh one.

-   Config: acl
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_ACL
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""
-   Examples:
    -   “private”
        -   Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. No one else has access rights
            (default).
    -   “public-read”
        -   Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AllUsers group gets READ
            access.
    -   “public-read-write”
        -   Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AllUsers group gets READ and
            WRITE access.
        -   Granting this on a bucket is generally not recommended.
    -   “authenticated-read”
        -   Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AuthenticatedUsers group gets
            READ access.
    -   “bucket-owner-read”
        -   Object owner gets FULL_CONTROL. Bucket owner gets READ
            access.
        -   If you specify this canned ACL when creating a bucket,
            Amazon S3 ignores it.
    -   “bucket-owner-full-control”
        -   Both the object owner and the bucket owner get FULL_CONTROL
            over the object.

–s3-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload

Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of chunk_size. The
minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5GB.

-   Config: upload_cutoff
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 200M

–s3-chunk-size

Chunk size to use for uploading.

When uploading files larger than upload_cutoff they will be uploaded as
multipart uploads using this chunk size.

Note that “–s3-upload-concurrency” chunks of this size are buffered in
memory per transfer.

If you are transferring large files over high speed links and you have
enough memory, then increasing this will speed up the transfers.

-   Config: chunk_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_CHUNK_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 5M

–s3-disable-checksum

Don’t store MD5 checksum with object metadata

-   Config: disable_checksum
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_DISABLE_CHECKSUM
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–s3-session-token

An AWS session token

-   Config: session_token
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_SESSION_TOKEN
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–s3-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for multipart uploads.

This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded
concurrently.

If you are uploading small numbers of large file over high speed link
and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing
this may help to speed up the transfers.

-   Config: upload_concurrency
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
-   Type: int
-   Default: 4

–s3-force-path-style

If true use path style access if false use virtual hosted style.

If this is true (the default) then rclone will use path style access, if
false then rclone will use virtual path style. See the AWS S3 docs for
more info.

Some providers (eg Aliyun OSS or Netease COS) require this set to false.

-   Config: force_path_style
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: true

–s3-v2-auth

If true use v2 authentication.

If this is false (the default) then rclone will use v4 authentication.
If it is set then rclone will use v2 authentication.

Use this only if v4 signatures don’t work, eg pre Jewel/v10 CEPH.

-   Config: v2_auth
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_V2_AUTH
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–s3-use-accelerate-endpoint

If true use the AWS S3 accelerated endpoint.

See: AWS S3 Transfer acceleration

-   Config: use_accelerate_endpoint
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_USE_ACCELERATE_ENDPOINT
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–s3-leave-parts-on-error

If true avoid calling abort upload on a failure, leaving all
successfully uploaded parts on S3 for manual recovery.

It should be set to true for resuming uploads across different sessions.

WARNING: Storing parts of an incomplete multipart upload counts towards
space usage on S3 and will add additional costs if not cleaned up.

-   Config: leave_parts_on_error
-   Env Var: RCLONE_S3_LEAVE_PARTS_ON_ERROR
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

Anonymous access to public buckets

If you want to use rclone to access a public bucket, configure with a
blank access_key_id and secret_access_key. Your config should end up
looking like this:

    [anons3]
    type = s3
    provider = AWS
    env_auth = false
    access_key_id = 
    secret_access_key = 
    region = us-east-1
    endpoint = 
    location_constraint = 
    acl = private
    server_side_encryption = 
    storage_class = 

Then use it as normal with the name of the public bucket, eg

    rclone lsd anons3:1000genomes

You will be able to list and copy data but not upload it.

Ceph

Ceph is an open source unified, distributed storage system designed for
excellent performance, reliability and scalability. It has an S3
compatible object storage interface.

To use rclone with Ceph, configure as above but leave the region blank
and set the endpoint. You should end up with something like this in your
config:

    [ceph]
    type = s3
    provider = Ceph
    env_auth = false
    access_key_id = XXX
    secret_access_key = YYY
    region =
    endpoint = https://ceph.endpoint.example.com
    location_constraint =
    acl =
    server_side_encryption =
    storage_class =

If you are using an older version of CEPH, eg 10.2.x Jewel, then you may
need to supply the parameter --s3-upload-cutoff 0 or put this in the
config file as upload_cutoff 0 to work around a bug which causes
uploading of small files to fail.

Note also that Ceph sometimes puts / in the passwords it gives users. If
you read the secret access key using the command line tools you will get
a JSON blob with the / escaped as \/. Make sure you only write / in the
secret access key.

Eg the dump from Ceph looks something like this (irrelevant keys
removed).

    {
        "user_id": "xxx",
        "display_name": "xxxx",
        "keys": [
            {
                "user": "xxx",
                "access_key": "xxxxxx",
                "secret_key": "xxxxxx\/xxxx"
            }
        ],
    }

Because this is a json dump, it is encoding the / as \/, so if you use
the secret key as xxxxxx/xxxx it will work fine.

Dreamhost

Dreamhost DreamObjects is an object storage system based on CEPH.

To use rclone with Dreamhost, configure as above but leave the region
blank and set the endpoint. You should end up with something like this
in your config:

    [dreamobjects]
    type = s3
    provider = DreamHost
    env_auth = false
    access_key_id = your_access_key
    secret_access_key = your_secret_key
    region =
    endpoint = objects-us-west-1.dream.io
    location_constraint =
    acl = private
    server_side_encryption =
    storage_class =

DigitalOcean Spaces

Spaces is an S3-interoperable object storage service from cloud provider
DigitalOcean.

To connect to DigitalOcean Spaces you will need an access key and secret
key. These can be retrieved on the “Applications & API” page of the
DigitalOcean control panel. They will be needed when promted by
rclone config for your access_key_id and secret_access_key.

When prompted for a region or location_constraint, press enter to use
the default value. The region must be included in the endpoint setting
(e.g. nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com). The default values can be used for
other settings.

Going through the whole process of creating a new remote by running
rclone config, each prompt should be answered as shown below:

    Storage> s3
    env_auth> 1
    access_key_id> YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    secret_access_key> YOUR_SECRET_KEY
    region>
    endpoint> nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
    location_constraint>
    acl>
    storage_class>

The resulting configuration file should look like:

    [spaces]
    type = s3
    provider = DigitalOcean
    env_auth = false
    access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
    region =
    endpoint = nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
    location_constraint =
    acl =
    server_side_encryption =
    storage_class =

Once configured, you can create a new Space and begin copying files. For
example:

    rclone mkdir spaces:my-new-space
    rclone copy /path/to/files spaces:my-new-space

IBM COS (S3)

9.  Specify a canned ACL. IBM Cloud (Strorage) supports “public-read”
    and “private”. IBM Cloud(Infra) supports all the canned ACLs.
    On-Premise COS supports all the canned ACLs.

    Canned ACL used when creating buckets and/or storing objects in S3.
    For more info visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
          1 / Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. No one else has access rights (default). This acl is available on IBM Cloud (Infra), IBM Cloud (Storage), On-Premise COS
          \ "private"
          2  / Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AllUsers group gets READ access. This acl is available on IBM Cloud (Infra), IBM Cloud (Storage), On-Premise IBM COS

          \ "public-read-write"
          4  / Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AuthenticatedUsers group gets READ access. Not supported on Buckets. This acl is available on IBM Cloud (Infra) and On-Premise IBM COS
          \ "authenticated-read"
    acl> 1

12. Review the displayed configuration and accept to save the “remote”
    then quit. The config file should look like this

        [xxx]
        type = s3
        Provider = IBMCOS
        access_key_id = xxx
        secret_access_key = yyy
        endpoint = s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net
        location_constraint = us-standard
        acl = private

13. Execute rclone commands

        1)  Create a bucket.
            rclone mkdir IBM-COS-XREGION:newbucket
        2)  List available buckets.
            rclone lsd IBM-COS-XREGION:
            -1 2017-11-08 21:16:22        -1 test
            -1 2018-02-14 20:16:39        -1 newbucket
        3)  List contents of a bucket.
            rclone ls IBM-COS-XREGION:newbucket
            18685952 test.exe
        4)  Copy a file from local to remote.
            rclone copy /Users/file.txt IBM-COS-XREGION:newbucket
        5)  Copy a file from remote to local.
            rclone copy IBM-COS-XREGION:newbucket/file.txt .
        6)  Delete a file on remote.
            rclone delete IBM-COS-XREGION:newbucket/file.txt

Minio

Minio is an object storage server built for cloud application developers
and devops.

It is very easy to install and provides an S3 compatible server which
can be used by rclone.

To use it, install Minio following the instructions here.

When it configures itself Minio will print something like this

    Endpoint:  http://192.168.1.106:9000  http://172.23.0.1:9000
    AccessKey: USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE
    SecretKey: MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03
    Region:    us-east-1
    SQS ARNs:  arn:minio:sqs:us-east-1:1:redis arn:minio:sqs:us-east-1:2:redis

    Browser Access:
       http://192.168.1.106:9000  http://172.23.0.1:9000

    Command-line Access: https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide
       $ mc config host add myminio http://192.168.1.106:9000 USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03

    Object API (Amazon S3 compatible):
       Go:         https://docs.minio.io/docs/golang-client-quickstart-guide
       Java:       https://docs.minio.io/docs/java-client-quickstart-guide
       Python:     https://docs.minio.io/docs/python-client-quickstart-guide
       JavaScript: https://docs.minio.io/docs/javascript-client-quickstart-guide
       .NET:       https://docs.minio.io/docs/dotnet-client-quickstart-guide

    Drive Capacity: 26 GiB Free, 165 GiB Total

These details need to go into rclone config like this. Note that it is
important to put the region in as stated above.

    env_auth> 1
    access_key_id> USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE
    secret_access_key> MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03
    region> us-east-1
    endpoint> http://192.168.1.106:9000
    location_constraint>
    server_side_encryption>

Which makes the config file look like this

    [minio]
    type = s3
    provider = Minio
    env_auth = false
    access_key_id = USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE
    secret_access_key = MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03
    region = us-east-1
    endpoint = http://192.168.1.106:9000
    location_constraint =
    server_side_encryption =

So once set up, for example to copy files into a bucket

    rclone copy /path/to/files minio:bucket

Scaleway

Scaleway The Object Storage platform allows you to store anything from
backups, logs and web assets to documents and photos. Files can be
dropped from the Scaleway console or transferred through our API and CLI
or using any S3-compatible tool.

Netease NOS

For Netease NOS configure as per the configurator rclone config setting
the provider Netease. This will automatically set
force_path_style = false which is necessary for it to run properly.


Backblaze B2

B2 is Backblaze’s cloud storage system.

Paths are specified as remote:bucket (or remote: for the lsd command.)
You may put subdirectories in too, eg remote:bucket/path/to/dir.

Here is an example of making a b2 configuration. First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process. To
authenticate you will either need your Account ID (a short hex number)
and Master Application Key (a long hex number) OR an Application Key,
which is the recommended method. See below for further details on
generating and using an Application Key.

    endpoint =
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

This remote is called remote and can now be used like this

See all buckets

    rclone lsd remote:

Create a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote bucket, deleting any excess
files in the bucket.

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:bucket

Application Keys

B2 supports multiple Application Keys for different access permission to
B2 Buckets.

You can use these with rclone too; you will need to use rclone version
1.43 or later.

Follow Backblaze’s docs to create an Application Key with the required
permission and add the applicationKeyId as the account and the
Application Key itself as the key.

Note that you must put the _applicationKeyId_ as the account – you can’t
use the master Account ID. If you try then B2 will return 401 errors.

–fast-list

This remote supports --fast-list which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the rclone docs for more
details.

Modified time

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
X-Bz-Info-src_last_modified_millis as milliseconds since 1970-01-01 in
the Backblaze standard. Other tools should be able to use this as a
modified time.

Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported. Note that if
a modification time needs to be updated on an object then it will create
a new version of the object.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  \            0x5C        ＼

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in JSON
strings.

SHA1 checksums

The SHA1 checksums of the files are checked on upload and download and
will be used in the syncing process.

Large files (bigger than the limit in --b2-upload-cutoff) which are
uploaded in chunks will store their SHA1 on the object as
X-Bz-Info-large_file_sha1 as recommended by Backblaze.

For a large file to be uploaded with an SHA1 checksum, the source needs
to support SHA1 checksums. The local disk supports SHA1 checksums so
large file transfers from local disk will have an SHA1. See the overview
for exactly which remotes support SHA1.

Sources which don’t support SHA1, in particular crypt will upload large
files without SHA1 checksums. This may be fixed in the future (see
#1767).

Files sizes below --b2-upload-cutoff will always have an SHA1 regardless
of the source.

Transfers

Backblaze recommends that you do lots of transfers simultaneously for
maximum speed. In tests from my SSD equipped laptop the optimum setting
is about --transfers 32 though higher numbers may be used for a slight
speed improvement. The optimum number for you may vary depending on your
hardware, how big the files are, how much you want to load your
computer, etc. The default of --transfers 4 is definitely too low for
Backblaze B2 though.

Note that uploading big files (bigger than 200 MB by default) will use a
96 MB RAM buffer by default. There can be at most --transfers of these
in use at any moment, so this sets the upper limit on the memory used.

Versions

When rclone uploads a new version of a file it creates a new version of
it. Likewise when you delete a file, the old version will be marked
hidden and still be available. Conversely, you may opt in to a “hard
delete” of files with the --b2-hard-delete flag which would permanently
remove the file instead of hiding it.

Old versions of files, where available, are visible using the
--b2-versions flag.

NB Note that --b2-versions does not work with crypt at the moment #1627.
Using –backup-dir with rclone is the recommended way of working around
this.

If you wish to remove all the old versions then you can use the
rclone cleanup remote:bucket command which will delete all the old
versions of files, leaving the current ones intact. You can also supply
a path and only old versions under that path will be deleted, eg
rclone cleanup remote:bucket/path/to/stuff.

Note that cleanup will remove partially uploaded files from the bucket
if they are more than a day old.

When you purge a bucket, the current and the old versions will be
deleted then the bucket will be deleted.

However delete will cause the current versions of the files to become
hidden old versions.

Here is a session showing the listing and retrieval of an old version
followed by a cleanup of the old versions.

Show current version and all the versions with --b2-versions flag.

    $ rclone -q ls b2:cleanup-test
            9 one.txt

    $ rclone -q --b2-versions ls b2:cleanup-test
            9 one.txt
            8 one-v2016-07-04-141032-000.txt
           16 one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
           15 one-v2016-07-02-155621-000.txt

Retrieve an old version

    $ rclone -q --b2-versions copy b2:cleanup-test/one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt /tmp

    $ ls -l /tmp/one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 ncw ncw 16 Jul  2 17:46 /tmp/one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt

Clean up all the old versions and show that they’ve gone.

    $ rclone -q cleanup b2:cleanup-test

    $ rclone -q ls b2:cleanup-test
            9 one.txt

    $ rclone -q --b2-versions ls b2:cleanup-test
            9 one.txt

Data usage

It is useful to know how many requests are sent to the server in
different scenarios.

All copy commands send the following 4 requests:

    /b2api/v1/b2_authorize_account
    /b2api/v1/b2_create_bucket
    /b2api/v1/b2_list_buckets
    /b2api/v1/b2_list_file_names

The b2_list_file_names request will be sent once for every 1k files in
the remote path, providing the checksum and modification time of the
listed files. As of version 1.33 issue #818 causes extra requests to be
sent when using B2 with Crypt. When a copy operation does not require
any files to be uploaded, no more requests will be sent.

Uploading files that do not require chunking, will send 2 requests per
file upload:

    /b2api/v1/b2_get_upload_url
    /b2api/v1/b2_upload_file/

Uploading files requiring chunking, will send 2 requests (one each to
start and finish the upload) and another 2 requests for each chunk:

    /b2api/v1/b2_start_large_file
    /b2api/v1/b2_get_upload_part_url
    /b2api/v1/b2_upload_part/
    /b2api/v1/b2_finish_large_file

Versions

Versions can be viewed with the --b2-versions flag. When it is set
rclone will show and act on older versions of files. For example

Listing without --b2-versions

    $ rclone -q ls b2:cleanup-test
            9 one.txt

And with

    $ rclone -q --b2-versions ls b2:cleanup-test
            9 one.txt
            8 one-v2016-07-04-141032-000.txt
           16 one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
           15 one-v2016-07-02-155621-000.txt

Showing that the current version is unchanged but older versions can be
seen. These have the UTC date that they were uploaded to the server to
the nearest millisecond appended to them.

Note that when using --b2-versions no file write operations are
permitted, so you can’t upload files or delete them.

B2 and rclone link

Rclone supports generating file share links for private B2 buckets. They
can either be for a file for example:

    ./rclone link B2:bucket/path/to/file.txt
    https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/to/file.txt?Authorization=xxxxxxxx

or if run on a directory you will get:

    ./rclone link B2:bucket/path
    https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path?Authorization=xxxxxxxx

you can then use the authorization token (the part of the url from the
?Authorization= on) on any file path under that directory. For example:

    https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/to/file1?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
    https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/file2?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
    https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/folder/file3?Authorization=xxxxxxxx

Box

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, eg remote:directory/subdirectory.

The initial setup for Box involves getting a token from Box which you
can do either in your browser, or with a config.json downloaded from Box
to use JWT authentication. rclone config walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Box
       \ "box"
    [snip]
    Storage> box
    Box App Client Id - leave blank normally.
    client_id> 
    Box App Client Secret - leave blank normally.
    client_secret>
    Box App config.json location
    Leave blank normally.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    config_json>
    'enterprise' or 'user' depending on the type of token being requested.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("user").
    box_sub_type>
    Remote config
    Use auto config?
     * Say Y if not sure
     * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> y
    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    --------------------
    [remote]
    client_id = 
    client_secret = 
    token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"XXX"}
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

See the remote setup docs for how to set it up on a machine with no
Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Box. This only runs from the moment it opens your
browser to the moment you get back the verification code. This is on
http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it may require you to unblock it
temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your Box

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Box

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Box directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Using rclone with an Enterprise account with SSO

If you have an “Enterprise” account type with Box with single sign on
(SSO), you need to create a password to use Box with rclone. This can be
done at your Enterprise Box account by going to Settings, “Account” Tab,
and then set the password in the “Authentication” field.

Once you have done this, you can setup your Enterprise Box account using
the same procedure detailed above in the, using the password you have
just set.

Invalid refresh token

According to the box docs:

  Each refresh_token is valid for one use in 60 days.

This means that if you

-   Don’t use the box remote for 60 days
-   Copy the config file with a box refresh token in and use it in two
    places
-   Get an error on a token refresh

then rclone will return an error which includes the text
Invalid refresh token.

To fix this you will need to use oauth2 again to update the refresh
token. You can use the methods in the remote setup docs, bearing in mind
that if you use the copy the config file method, you should not use that
remote on the computer you did the authentication on.

Here is how to do it.

    $ rclone config
    Current remotes:

    Name                 Type
    ====                 ====
    remote               box

    e) Edit existing remote
    n) New remote
    d) Delete remote
    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/r/c/s/q> e
    Choose a number from below, or type in an existing value
     1 > remote
    remote> remote
    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = box
    token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"2017-07-08T23:40:08.059167677+01:00"}
    --------------------
    Edit remote
    Value "client_id" = ""
    Edit? (y/n)>
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> n
    Value "client_secret" = ""
    Edit? (y/n)>
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> n
    Remote config

    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> y
    Use auto config?
     * Say Y if not sure
     * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> y
    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = box
    token = {"access_token":"YYY","token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"YYY","expiry":"2017-07-23T12:22:29.259137901+01:00"}
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

Modified time and hashes

Box allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1 second.
These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or not.

Box supports SHA1 type hashes, so you can use the --checksum flag.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  \            0x5C        ＼

File names can also not end with the following characters. These only
get replaced if they are last character in the name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  SP           0x20         ␠

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in JSON
strings.

Transfers

For files above 50MB rclone will use a chunked transfer. Rclone will
upload up to --transfers chunks at the same time (shared among all the
multipart uploads). Chunks are buffered in memory and are normally 8MB
so increasing --transfers will increase memory use.

Deleting files

Depending on the enterprise settings for your user, the item will either
be actually deleted from Box or moved to the trash.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to box (Box).

–box-client-id

Box App Client Id. Leave blank normally.

-   Config: client_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_BOX_CLIENT_ID
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–box-client-secret

Box App Client Secret Leave blank normally.

-   Config: client_secret
-   Env Var: RCLONE_BOX_CLIENT_SECRET
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–box-box-config-file

Box App config.json location Leave blank normally.

-   Config: box_config_file
-   Env Var: RCLONE_BOX_BOX_CONFIG_FILE
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–box-box-sub-type

-   Config: box_sub_type
-   Env Var: RCLONE_BOX_BOX_SUB_TYPE
-   Type: string
-   Default: “user”
-   Examples:
    -   “user”
        -   Rclone should act on behalf of a user
    -   “enterprise”
        -   Rclone should act on behalf of a service account

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to box (Box).

–box-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to multipart upload (>= 50MB).

-   Config: upload_cutoff
-   Env Var: RCLONE_BOX_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 50M

–box-commit-retries

Max number of times to try committing a multipart file.

-   Config: commit_retries
-   Env Var: RCLONE_BOX_COMMIT_RETRIES
-   Type: int
-   Default: 100

Limitations

Note that Box is case insensitive so you can’t have a file called
“Hello.doc” and one called “hello.doc”.

Box file names can’t have the \ character in. rclone maps this to and
from an identical looking unicode equivalent ＼.

Box only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.


Cache (BETA)

The cache remote wraps another existing remote and stores file structure
and its data for long running tasks like rclone mount.

To get started you just need to have an existing remote which can be
configured with cache.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called test-cache. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/r/c/s/q> n
    name> test-cache
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Cache a remote
       \ "cache"
    [snip]
    Storage> cache
    Remote to cache.
    Normally should contain a ':' and a path, eg "myremote:path/to/dir",
    "myremote:bucket" or maybe "myremote:" (not recommended).
    remote> local:/test
    Optional: The URL of the Plex server
    plex_url> http://127.0.0.1:32400
    Optional: The username of the Plex user
    plex_username> dummyusername
    Optional: The password of the Plex user
    y) Yes type in my own password
    g) Generate random password
    n) No leave this optional password blank
    y/g/n> y
    Enter the password:
    password:
    Confirm the password:
    password:
    The size of a chunk. Lower value good for slow connections but can affect seamless reading.
    Default: 5M
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
     1 / 1MB
       \ "1m"
     2 / 5 MB
       \ "5M"
     3 / 10 MB
       \ "10M"
    chunk_size> 2
    How much time should object info (file size, file hashes etc) be stored in cache. Use a very high value if you don't plan on changing the source FS from outside the cache.
    Accepted units are: "s", "m", "h".
    Default: 5m
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
     1 / 1 hour
       \ "1h"
     2 / 24 hours
       \ "24h"
     3 / 24 hours
       \ "48h"
    info_age> 2
    The maximum size of stored chunks. When the storage grows beyond this size, the oldest chunks will be deleted.
    Default: 10G
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
     1 / 500 MB
       \ "500M"
     2 / 1 GB
       \ "1G"
     3 / 10 GB
       \ "10G"
    chunk_total_size> 3
    Remote config
    --------------------
    [test-cache]
    remote = local:/test
    plex_url = http://127.0.0.1:32400
    plex_username = dummyusername
    plex_password = *** ENCRYPTED ***
    chunk_size = 5M
    info_age = 48h
    chunk_total_size = 10G

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your drive

    rclone lsd test-cache:

List all the files in your drive

    rclone ls test-cache:

To start a cached mount

    rclone mount --allow-other test-cache: /var/tmp/test-cache

Write Features

Offline uploading

In an effort to make writing through cache more reliable, the backend
now supports this feature which can be activated by specifying a
cache-tmp-upload-path.

A files goes through these states when using this feature:

1.  An upload is started (usually by copying a file on the cache remote)
2.  When the copy to the temporary location is complete the file is part
    of the cached remote and looks and behaves like any other file
    (reading included)
3.  After cache-tmp-wait-time passes and the file is next in line,
    rclone move is used to move the file to the cloud provider
4.  Reading the file still works during the upload but most
    modifications on it will be prohibited
5.  Once the move is complete the file is unlocked for modifications as
    it becomes as any other regular file
6.  If the file is being read through cache when it’s actually deleted
    from the temporary path then cache will simply swap the source to
    the cloud provider without interrupting the reading (small blip can
    happen though)

Files are uploaded in sequence and only one file is uploaded at a time.
Uploads will be stored in a queue and be processed based on the order
they were added. The queue and the temporary storage is persistent
across restarts but can be cleared on startup with the --cache-db-purge
flag.

Write Support

Writes are supported through cache. One caveat is that a mounted cache
remote does not add any retry or fallback mechanism to the upload
operation. This will depend on the implementation of the wrapped remote.
Consider using Offline uploading for reliable writes.

One special case is covered with cache-writes which will cache the file
data at the same time as the upload when it is enabled making it
available from the cache store immediately once the upload is finished.

Read Features

Multiple connections

To counter the high latency between a local PC where rclone is running
and cloud providers, the cache remote can split multiple requests to the
cloud provider for smaller file chunks and combines them together
locally where they can be available almost immediately before the reader
usually needs them.

This is similar to buffering when media files are played online. Rclone
will stay around the current marker but always try its best to stay
ahead and prepare the data before.

Plex Integration

There is a direct integration with Plex which allows cache to detect
during reading if the file is in playback or not. This helps cache to
adapt how it queries the cloud provider depending on what is needed for.

Scans will have a minimum amount of workers (1) while in a confirmed
playback cache will deploy the configured number of workers.

This integration opens the doorway to additional performance
improvements which will be explored in the near future.

NOTE: If Plex options are not configured, cache will function with its
configured options without adapting any of its settings.

How to enable? Run rclone config and add all the Plex options (endpoint,
username and password) in your remote and it will be automatically
enabled.

Affected settings: - cache-workers: _Configured value_ during confirmed
playback or _1_ all the other times

Certificate Validation

When the Plex server is configured to only accept secure connections, it
is possible to use .plex.direct URL’s to ensure certificate validation
succeeds. These URL’s are used by Plex internally to connect to the Plex
server securely.

The format for this URL’s is the following:

https://ip-with-dots-replaced.server-hash.plex.direct:32400/

The ip-with-dots-replaced part can be any IPv4 address, where the dots
have been replaced with dashes, e.g. 127.0.0.1 becomes 127-0-0-1.

To get the server-hash part, the easiest way is to visit

https://plex.tv/api/resources?includeHttps=1&X-Plex-Token=your-plex-token

This page will list all the available Plex servers for your account with
at least one .plex.direct link for each. Copy one URL and replace the IP
address with the desired address. This can be used as the plex_url
value.

Known issues

Mount and –dir-cache-time

–dir-cache-time controls the first layer of directory caching which
works at the mount layer. Being an independent caching mechanism from
the cache backend, it will manage its own entries based on the
configured time.

To avoid getting in a scenario where dir cache has obsolete data and
cache would have the correct one, try to set --dir-cache-time to a lower
time than --cache-info-age. Default values are already configured in
this way.

Windows support - Experimental

There are a couple of issues with Windows mount functionality that still
require some investigations. It should be considered as experimental
thus far as fixes come in for this OS.

Most of the issues seem to be related to the difference between
filesystems on Linux flavors and Windows as cache is heavily dependant
on them.

Any reports or feedback on how cache behaves on this OS is greatly
appreciated.

Risk of throttling

Future iterations of the cache backend will make use of the pooling
functionality of the cloud provider to synchronize and at the same time
make writing through it more tolerant to failures.

There are a couple of enhancements in track to add these but in the
meantime there is a valid concern that the expiring cache listings can
lead to cloud provider throttles or bans due to repeated queries on it
for very large mounts.

Some recommendations: - don’t use a very small interval for entry
informations (--cache-info-age) - while writes aren’t yet optimised, you
can still write through cache which gives you the advantage of adding
the file in the cache at the same time if configured to do so.

Future enhancements:

-   https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1937
-   https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1936

cache and crypt

One common scenario is to keep your data encrypted in the cloud provider
using the crypt remote. crypt uses a similar technique to wrap around an
existing remote and handles this translation in a seamless way.

There is an issue with wrapping the remotes in this order: CLOUD REMOTE
-> CRYPT -> CACHE

During testing, I experienced a lot of bans with the remotes in this
order. I suspect it might be related to how crypt opens files on the
cloud provider which makes it think we’re downloading the full file
instead of small chunks. Organizing the remotes in this order yields
better results: CLOUD REMOTE -> CACHE -> CRYPT

absolute remote paths

cache can not differentiate between relative and absolute paths for the
wrapped remote. Any path given in the remote config setting and on the
command line will be passed to the wrapped remote as is, but for storing
the chunks on disk the path will be made relative by removing any
leading / character.

This behavior is irrelevant for most backend types, but there are
backends where a leading / changes the effective directory, e.g. in the
sftp backend paths starting with a / are relative to the root of the SSH
server and paths without are relative to the user home directory. As a
result sftp:bin and sftp:/bin will share the same cache folder, even if
they represent a different directory on the SSH server.

Cache and Remote Control (–rc)

Cache supports the new --rc mode in rclone and can be remote controlled
through the following end points: By default, the listener is disabled
if you do not add the flag.

rc cache/expire

Purge a remote from the cache backend. Supports either a directory or a
file. It supports both encrypted and unencrypted file names if cache is
wrapped by crypt.

Params: - REMOTE = path to remote (REQUIRED) - WITHDATA = true/false to
delete cached data (chunks) as well _(optional, false by default)_

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to cache (Cache a remote).

–cache-remote

Remote to cache. Normally should contain a ‘:’ and a path, eg
“myremote:path/to/dir”, “myremote:bucket” or maybe “myremote:” (not
recommended).

-   Config: remote
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_REMOTE
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_PLEX_PASSWORD
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–cache-chunk-size

The size of a chunk (partial file data).

Use lower numbers for slower connections. If the chunk size is changed,
any downloaded chunks will be invalid and cache-chunk-path will need to
be cleared or unexpected EOF errors will occur.

-   Config: chunk_size

    -   “10M”
        -   10 MB

–cache-info-age

How long to cache file structure information (directory listings, file
size, times etc). If all write operations are done through the cache
then you can safely make this value very large as the cache store will
also be updated in real time.

-   Config: info_age
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_INFO_AGE
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 6h0m0s
-   Examples:
    -   “1h”
        -   1 hour

    -   “48h”
        -   48 hours

–cache-chunk-total-size

The total size that the chunks can take up on the local disk.

If the cache exceeds this value then it will start to delete the oldest
chunks until it goes under this value.

-   Default: ""

–cache-db-path

Directory to store file structure metadata DB. The remote name is used
as the DB file name.

-   Config: db_path
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_DB_PATH
-   Type: string
-   Default: “$HOME/.cache/rclone/cache-backend”

–cache-chunk-path

Directory to cache chunk files.

Path to where partial file data (chunks) are stored locally. The remote
name is appended to the final path.

This config follows the “–cache-db-path”. If you specify a custom
location for “–cache-db-path” and don’t specify one for
“–cache-chunk-path” then “–cache-chunk-path” will use the same path as
“–cache-db-path”.

-   Config: chunk_path
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_PATH
-   Type: string
-   Default: “$HOME/.cache/rclone/cache-backend”

–cache-db-purge

Clear all the cached data for this remote on start.

-   Config: db_purge
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_DB_PURGE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–cache-chunk-clean-interval

How often should the cache perform cleanups of the chunk storage. The
default value should be ok for most people. If you find that the cache
goes over “cache-chunk-total-size” too often then try to lower this
value to force it to perform cleanups more often.

-   Config: chunk_clean_interval
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_CLEAN_INTERVAL
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 1m0s

–cache-read-retries

How many times to retry a read from a cache storage.

Since reading from a cache stream is independent from downloading file
data, readers can get to a point where there’s no more data in the
cache. Most of the times this can indicate a connectivity issue if cache
isn’t able to provide file data anymore.

For really slow connections, increase this to a point where the stream
is able to provide data but your experience will be very stuttering.

-   Config: read_retries
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_READ_RETRIES
-   Type: int
-   Default: 10

–cache-workers

How many workers should run in parallel to download chunks.

Higher values will mean more parallel processing (better CPU needed) and
more concurrent requests on the cloud provider. This impacts several
aspects like the cloud provider API limits, more stress on the hardware
that rclone runs on but it also means that streams will be more fluid
and data will be available much more faster to readers.

NOTE: If the optional Plex integration is enabled then this setting will
adapt to the type of reading performed and the value specified here will
be used as a maximum number of workers to use.

-   Config: workers
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_WORKERS
-   Type: int
-   Default: 4

–cache-chunk-no-memory

Disable the in-memory cache for storing chunks during streaming.

By default, cache will keep file data during streaming in RAM as well to
provide it to readers as fast as possible.

This transient data is evicted as soon as it is read and the number of
chunks stored doesn’t exceed the number of workers. However, depending
on other settings like “cache-chunk-size” and “cache-workers” this
footprint can increase if there are parallel streams too (multiple files
being read at the same time).

If the hardware permits it, use this feature to provide an overall
better performance during streaming but it can also be disabled if RAM
is not available on the local machine.

-   Config: chunk_no_memory
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_NO_MEMORY
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–cache-rps

Limits the number of requests per second to the source FS (-1 to
disable)

This setting places a hard limit on the number of requests per second
that cache will be doing to the cloud provider remote and try to respect
that value by setting waits between reads.

If you find that you’re getting banned or limited on the cloud provider
through cache and know that a smaller number of requests per second will
allow you to work with it then you can use this setting for that.

A good balance of all the other settings should make this setting
useless but it is available to set for more special cases.

NOTE: This will limit the number of requests during streams but other
API calls to the cloud provider like directory listings will still pass.

-   Config: rps
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_RPS
-   Type: int
-   Default: -1

–cache-writes

Cache file data on writes through the FS

If you need to read files immediately after you upload them through
cache you can enable this flag to have their data stored in the cache
store at the same time during upload.

-   Config: writes
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_WRITES
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–cache-tmp-upload-path

Directory to keep temporary files until they are uploaded.

This is the path where cache will use as a temporary storage for new
files that need to be uploaded to the cloud provider.

Specifying a value will enable this feature. Without it, it is
completely disabled and files will be uploaded directly to the cloud
provider

-   Config: tmp_upload_path
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_TMP_UPLOAD_PATH
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–cache-tmp-wait-time

How long should files be stored in local cache before being uploaded

This is the duration that a file must wait in the temporary location
_cache-tmp-upload-path_ before it is selected for upload.

Note that only one file is uploaded at a time and it can take longer to
start the upload if a queue formed for this purpose.

-   Config: tmp_wait_time
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_TMP_WAIT_TIME
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 15s

–cache-db-wait-time

How long to wait for the DB to be available - 0 is unlimited

Only one process can have the DB open at any one time, so rclone waits
for this duration for the DB to become available before it gives an
error.

If you set it to 0 then it will wait forever.

-   Config: db_wait_time
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CACHE_DB_WAIT_TIME
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 1s


Chunker (BETA)

The chunker overlay transparently splits large files into smaller chunks
during upload to wrapped remote and transparently assembles them back
when the file is downloaded. This allows to effectively overcome size
limits imposed by storage providers.

To use it, first set up the underlying remote following the
configuration instructions for that remote. You can also use a local
pathname instead of a remote.

First check your chosen remote is working - we’ll call it remote:path
here. Note that anything inside remote:path will be chunked and anything
outside won’t. This means that if you are using a bucket based remote
(eg S3, B2, swift) then you should probably put the bucket in the remote
s3:bucket.

Now configure chunker using rclone config. We will call this one overlay
to separate it from the remote itself.

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config

Specifying the remote

In normal use, make sure the remote has a : in. If you specify the
remote without a : then rclone will use a local directory of that name.
So if you use a remote of /path/to/secret/files then rclone will chunk
stuff in that directory. If you use a remote of name then rclone will
put files in a directory called name in the current directory.

Chunking

When rclone starts a file upload, chunker checks the file size. If it
doesn’t exceed the configured chunk size, chunker will just pass the
file to the wrapped remote. If a file is large, chunker will
transparently cut data in pieces with temporary names and stream them
one by one, on the fly. Each data chunk will contain the specified
number of bytes, except for the last one which may have less data. If
file size is unknown in advance (this is called a streaming upload),
chunker will internally create a temporary copy, record its size and
repeat the above process.

When upload completes, temporary chunk files are finally renamed. This
scheme guarantees that operations can be run in parallel and look from
outside as atomic. A similar method with hidden temporary chunks is used
for other operations (copy/move/rename etc). If an operation fails,
hidden chunks are normally destroyed, and the target composite file
stays intact.

When a composite file download is requested, chunker transparently
assembles it by concatenating data chunks in order. As the split is
trivial one could even manually concatenate data chunks together to
obtain the original content.

When the list rclone command scans a directory on wrapped remote, the
potential chunk files are accounted for, grouped and assembled into
composite directory entries. Any temporary chunks are hidden.

List and other commands can sometimes come across composite files with
missing or invalid chunks, eg. shadowed by like-named directory or
another file. This usually means that wrapped file system has been
directly tampered with or damaged. If chunker detects a missing chunk it
will by default print warning, skip the whole incomplete group of chunks
but proceed with current command. You can set the --chunker-fail-hard
flag to have commands abort with error message in such cases.

Chunk names

The default chunk name format is *.rclone-chunk.###, hence by default
chunk names are BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone-chunk.001,
BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone-chunk.002 etc. You can configure a different name
format using the --chunker-name-format option. The format uses asterisk
* as a placeholder for the base file name and one or more consecutive
hash characters # as a placeholder for sequential chunk number. There
must be one and only one asterisk. The number of consecutive hash
characters defines the minimum length of a string representing a chunk
number. If decimal chunk number has less digits than the number of
hashes, it is left-padded by zeros. If the decimal string is longer, it
is left intact. By default numbering starts from 1 but there is another
option that allows user to start from 0, eg. for compatibility with
legacy software.

For example, if name format is big_*-##.part and original file name is
data.txt and numbering starts from 0, then the first chunk will be named
big_data.txt-00.part, the 99th chunk will be big_data.txt-98.part and
the 302nd chunk will become big_data.txt-301.part.

Note that list assembles composite directory entries only when chunk
names match the configured format and treats non-conforming file names
as normal non-chunked files.

Metadata

Besides data chunks chunker will by default create metadata object for a
composite file. The object is named after the original file. Chunker
allows user to disable metadata completely (the none format). Note that
metadata is normally not created for files smaller than the configured
chunk size. This may change in future rclone releases.

Simple JSON metadata format

This is the default format. It supports hash sums and chunk validation
for composite files. Meta objects carry the following fields:

-   ver - version of format, currently 1
-   size - total size of composite file
-   nchunks - number of data chunks in file
-   md5 - MD5 hashsum of composite file (if present)
-   sha1 - SHA1 hashsum (if present)

There is no field for composite file name as it’s simply equal to the
name of meta object on the wrapped remote. Please refer to respective
sections for details on hashsums and modified time handling.

No metadata

You can disable meta objects by setting the meta format option to none.
In this mode chunker will scan directory for all files that follow
configured chunk name format, group them by detecting chunks with the
same base name and show group names as virtual composite files. This
method is more prone to missing chunk errors (especially missing last
chunk) than format with metadata enabled.

Hashsums

Chunker supports hashsums only when a compatible metadata is present.
Hence, if you choose metadata format of none, chunker will report
hashsum as UNSUPPORTED.

Please note that by default metadata is stored only for composite files.
If a file is smaller than configured chunk size, chunker will
transparently redirect hash requests to wrapped remote, so support
depends on that. You will see the empty string as a hashsum of requested
type for small files if the wrapped remote doesn’t support it.

Many storage backends support MD5 and SHA1 hash types, so does chunker.
With chunker you can choose one or another but not both. MD5 is set by
default as the most supported type. Since chunker keeps hashes for
composite files and falls back to the wrapped remote hash for
non-chunked ones, we advise you to choose the same hash type as
supported by wrapped remote so that your file listings look coherent.

If your storage backend does not support MD5 or SHA1 but you need
consistent file hashing, configure chunker with md5all or sha1all. These
two modes guarantee given hash for all files. If wrapped remote doesn’t
support it, chunker will then add metadata to all files, even small.
However, this can double the amount of small files in storage and incur
additional service charges.

Normally, when a file is copied to chunker controlled remote, chunker
will ask the file source for compatible file hash and revert to
on-the-fly calculation if none is found. This involves some CPU overhead
but provides a guarantee that given hashsum is available. Also, chunker
will reject a server-side copy or move operation if source and
destination hashsum types are different resulting in the extra network
bandwidth, too. In some rare cases this may be undesired, so chunker
provides two optional choices: sha1quick and md5quick. If the source
does not support primary hash type and the quick mode is enabled,
chunker will try to fall back to the secondary type. This will save CPU
and bandwidth but can result in empty hashsums at destination. Beware of
consequences: the sync command will revert (sometimes silently) to
time/size comparison if compatible hashsums between source and target
are not found.

Modified time

Chunker stores modification times using the wrapped remote so support
depends on that. For a small non-chunked file the chunker overlay simply
manipulates modification time of the wrapped remote file. For a
composite file with metadata chunker will get and set modification time
of the metadata object on the wrapped remote. If file is chunked but
metadata format is none then chunker will use modification time of the
first data chunk.

Migrations

The idiomatic way to migrate to a different chunk size, hash type or
chunk naming scheme is to:

-   Collect all your chunked files under a directory and have your
    chunker remote point to it.
-   Create another directory (most probably on the same cloud storage)
    and configure a new remote with desired metadata format, hash type,
    chunk naming etc.
-   Now run rclone sync oldchunks: newchunks: and all your data will be
    transparently converted in transfer. This may take some time, yet
    chunker will try server-side copy if possible.
-   After checking data integrity you may remove configuration section
    of the old remote.

If rclone gets killed during a long operation on a big composite file,
hidden temporary chunks may stay in the directory. They will not be
shown by the list command but will eat up your account quota. Please
note that the deletefile command deletes only active chunks of a file.
As a workaround, you can use remote of the wrapped file system to see
them. An easy way to get rid of hidden garbage is to copy littered
directory somewhere using the chunker remote and purge the original
directory. The copy command will copy only active chunks while the purge
will remove everything including garbage.

Caveats and Limitations

Chunker requires wrapped remote to support server side move (or copy +
delete) operations, otherwise it will explicitly refuse to start. This
is because it internally renames temporary chunk files to their final
names when an operation completes successfully.

Note that a move implemented using the copy-and-delete method may incur
double charging with some cloud storage providers.

Chunker will not automatically rename existing chunks when you run
rclone config on a live remote and change the chunk name format. Beware
that in result of this some files which have been treated as chunks
before the change can pop up in directory listings as normal files and
vice versa. The same warning holds for the chunk size. If you
desperately need to change critical chunking setings, you should run
data migration as described above.

If wrapped remote is case insensitive, the chunker overlay will inherit
that property (so you can’t have a file called “Hello.doc” and
“hello.doc” in the same directory).

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to chunker (Transparently
chunk/split large files).

–chunker-remote

Remote to chunk/unchunk. Normally should contain a ‘:’ and a path, eg
“myremote:path/to/dir”, “myremote:bucket” or maybe “myremote:” (not
recommended).

Choose how chunker handles hash sums. All modes but “none” require
metadata.

-   Config: hash_type
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CHUNKER_HASH_TYPE
-   Type: string
-   Default: “md5”
-   Examples:
    -   “none”

        -   Similar to “md5quick” but prefers SHA1 over MD5

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to chunker (Transparently
chunk/split large files).

–chunker-name-format

String format of chunk file names. The two placeholders are: base file
name (*) and chunk number (#…). There must be one and only one asterisk
and one or more consecutive hash characters. If chunk number has less

Citrix ShareFile

Citrix ShareFile is a secure file sharing and transfer service aimed as
business.

The initial setup for Citrix ShareFile involves getting a token from
Citrix ShareFile which you can in your browser. rclone config walks you
through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n

    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    XX / Citrix Sharefile
       \ "sharefile"
    Storage> sharefile
    ** See help for sharefile backend at: https://rclone.org/sharefile/ **

    ID of the root folder

    Leave blank to access "Personal Folders".  You can use one of the
    standard values here or any folder ID (long hex number ID).
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
     1 / Access the Personal Folders. (Default)
       \ ""
     2 / Access the Favorites folder.
       \ "favorites"

    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = sharefile
    endpoint = https://XXX.sharefile.com
    token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"2019-09-30T19:41:45.878561877+01:00"}
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

See the remote setup docs for how to set it up on a machine with no
Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Citrix ShareFile. This only runs from the moment
it opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.
This is on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it may require you to
unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your ShareFile

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your ShareFile

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an ShareFile directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Paths may be as deep as required, eg remote:directory/subdirectory.

Modified time and hashes

ShareFile allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

ShareFile supports MD5 type hashes, so you can use the --checksum flag.

Transfers

For files above 128MB rclone will use a chunked transfer. Rclone will
upload up to --transfers chunks at the same time (shared among all the
multipart uploads). Chunks are buffered in memory and are normally 64MB
so increasing --transfers will increase memory use.

Limitations

Note that ShareFile is case insensitive so you can’t have a file called
“Hello.doc” and one called “hello.doc”.

ShareFile only supports filenames up to 256 characters in length.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  \            0x5C        ＼
  *            0x2A        ＊
  <            0x3C        ＜
  >            0x3E        ＞
  ?            0x3F        ？
  :            0x3A        ：
  |            0x7C        ｜
  "            0x22        ＂

File names can also not start or end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are first or last character in the name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  SP           0x20         ␠
  .            0x2E        ．

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in JSON
strings.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to sharefile (Citrix Sharefile).

-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 128M

–sharefile-chunk-size

Upload chunk size. Must a power of 2 >= 256k.

Making this larger will improve performance, but note that each chunk is
buffered in memory one per transfer.

Reducing this will reduce memory usage but decrease performance.

-   Config: chunk_size

–sharefile-endpoint

Endpoint for API calls.

This is usually auto discovered as part of the oauth process, but can be
set manually to something like: https://XXX.sharefile.com

-   Config: endpoint
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SHAREFILE_ENDPOINT
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""


Crypt

The crypt remote encrypts and decrypts another remote.

To use it first set up the underlying remote following the config
instructions for that remote. You can also use a local pathname instead
of a remote which will encrypt and decrypt from that directory which
might be useful for encrypting onto a USB stick for example.

First check your chosen remote is working - we’ll call it remote:path in
these docs. Note that anything inside remote:path will be encrypted and
anything outside won’t. This means that if you are using a bucket based
remote (eg S3, B2, swift) then you should probably put the bucket in the
remote s3:bucket. If you just use s3: then rclone will make encrypted
bucket names too (if using file name encryption) which may or may not be
what you want.

Now configure crypt using rclone config. We will call this one secret to
differentiate it from the remote.

    No remotes found - make a new one

    password2 = *** ENCRYPTED ***
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

IMPORTANT The password is stored in the config file is lightly obscured
so it isn’t immediately obvious what it is. It is in no way secure
unless you use config file encryption.

A long passphrase is recommended, or you can use a random one. Note that
if you reconfigure rclone with the same passwords/passphrases elsewhere
it will be compatible - all the secrets used are derived from those two
passwords/passphrases.

Note that rclone does not encrypt

-   file length - this can be calcuated within 16 bytes
-   modification time - used for syncing


Specifying the remote

In normal use, make sure the remote has a : in. If you specify the
remote without a : then rclone will use a local directory of that name.
So if you use a remote of /path/to/secret/files then rclone will encrypt
stuff to that directory. If you use a remote of name then rclone will
put files in a directory called name in the current directory.

If you specify the remote as remote:path/to/dir then rclone will store
encrypted files in path/to/dir on the remote. If you are using file name
encryption, then when you save files to secret:subdir/subfile this will
store them in the unencrypted path path/to/dir but the subdir/subpath
bit will be encrypted.

Note that unless you want encrypted bucket names (which are difficult to
manage because you won’t know what directory they represent in web
interfaces etc), you should probably specify a bucket, eg
remote:secretbucket when using bucket based remotes such as S3, Swift,
Hubic, B2, GCS.


Example

To test I made a little directory of files using “standard” file name
encryption.

    plaintext/
    ├── file0.txt
    ├── file1.txt
    └── subdir
        ├── file2.txt
        ├── file3.txt
        └── subsubdir
            └── file4.txt

Copy these to the remote and list them back

    $ rclone -q copy plaintext secret:
    $ rclone -q ls secret:
            7 file1.txt
            6 file0.txt
            8 subdir/file2.txt
           10 subdir/subsubdir/file4.txt
            9 subdir/file3.txt

Now see what that looked like when encrypted

    $ rclone -q ls remote:path
           55 hagjclgavj2mbiqm6u6cnjjqcg
           54 v05749mltvv1tf4onltun46gls
           57 86vhrsv86mpbtd3a0akjuqslj8/dlj7fkq4kdq72emafg7a7s41uo
           58 86vhrsv86mpbtd3a0akjuqslj8/7uu829995du6o42n32otfhjqp4/b9pausrfansjth5ob3jkdqd4lc
           56 86vhrsv86mpbtd3a0akjuqslj8/8njh1sk437gttmep3p70g81aps

Note that this retains the directory structure which means you can do
this

    $ rclone -q ls secret:subdir
            8 file2.txt
            9 file3.txt
           10 subsubdir/file4.txt

If don’t use file name encryption then the remote will look like this -
note the .bin extensions added to prevent the cloud provider attempting
to interpret the data.

    $ rclone -q ls remote:path
           54 file0.txt.bin
           57 subdir/file3.txt.bin
           56 subdir/file2.txt.bin
           58 subdir/subsubdir/file4.txt.bin
           55 file1.txt.bin

File name encryption modes

Here are some of the features of the file name encryption modes

Off

-   doesn’t hide file names or directory structure
-   allows for longer file names (~246 characters)
-   can use sub paths and copy single files

Standard

-   file names encrypted
-   file names can’t be as long (~143 characters)
-   can use sub paths and copy single files
-   directory structure visible
-   identical files names will have identical uploaded names
-   can use shortcuts to shorten the directory recursion

Obfuscation

This is a simple “rotate” of the filename, with each file having a rot
distance based on the filename. We store the distance at the beginning
of the filename. So a file called “hello” may become “53.jgnnq”

This is not a strong encryption of filenames, but it may stop automated
scanning tools from picking up on filename patterns. As such it’s an
intermediate between “off” and “standard”. The advantage is that it
allows for longer path segment names.

There is a possibility with some unicode based filenames that the
obfuscation is weak and may map lower case characters to upper case
equivalents. You can not rely on this for strong protection.

-   file names very lightly obfuscated
-   file names can be longer than standard encryption
-   can use sub paths and copy single files
-   directory structure visible
-   identical files names will have identical uploaded names

Cloud storage systems have various limits on file name length and total
path length which you are more likely to hit using “Standard” file name
encryption. If you keep your file names to below 156 characters in
length then you should be OK on all providers.

There may be an even more secure file name encryption mode in the future
which will address the long file name problem.

Directory name encryption

Crypt offers the option of encrypting dir names or leaving them intact.
There are two options:

True

Encrypts the whole file path including directory names Example:
1/12/123.txt is encrypted to
p0e52nreeaj0a5ea7s64m4j72s/l42g6771hnv3an9cgc8cr2n1ng/qgm4avr35m5loi1th53ato71v0

False

Only encrypts file names, skips directory names Example: 1/12/123.txt is
encrypted to 1/12/qgm4avr35m5loi1th53ato71v0

Modified time and hashes

Crypt stores modification times using the underlying remote so support
depends on that.

Hashes are not stored for crypt. However the data integrity is protected
by an extremely strong crypto authenticator.

Note that you should use the rclone cryptcheck command to check the
integrity of a crypted remote instead of rclone check which can’t check
the checksums properly.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to crypt (Encrypt/Decrypt a
remote).

–crypt-remote

Remote to encrypt/decrypt. Normally should contain a ‘:’ and a path, eg
“myremote:path/to/dir”, “myremote:bucket” or maybe “myremote:” (not
recommended).

-   Config: remote
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_REMOTE
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–crypt-filename-encryption

How to encrypt the filenames.

-   Config: filename_encryption
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_FILENAME_ENCRYPTION
-   Type: string
-   Default: “standard”
-   Examples:
    -   “off”
        -   Don’t encrypt the file names. Adds a “.bin” extension only.
    -   “standard”
        -   Encrypt the filenames see the docs for the details.
    -   “obfuscate”
        -   Very simple filename obfuscation.

–crypt-directory-name-encryption

Option to either encrypt directory names or leave them intact.

-   Config: directory_name_encryption
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_DIRECTORY_NAME_ENCRYPTION
-   Type: bool
-   Default: true
-   Examples:
    -   “true”
        -   Encrypt directory names.
    -   “false”
        -   Don’t encrypt directory names, leave them intact.

–crypt-password

Password or pass phrase for encryption.

-   Config: password
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_PASSWORD
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–crypt-password2

Password or pass phrase for salt. Optional but recommended. Should be
different to the previous password.

-   Config: password2
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_PASSWORD2
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to crypt (Encrypt/Decrypt a
remote).

–crypt-show-mapping

For all files listed show how the names encrypt.

If this flag is set then for each file that the remote is asked to list,
it will log (at level INFO) a line stating the decrypted file name and
the encrypted file name.

This is so you can work out which encrypted names are which decrypted
names just in case you need to do something with the encrypted file
names, or for debugging purposes.

-   Config: show_mapping
-   Env Var: RCLONE_CRYPT_SHOW_MAPPING
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false


Backing up a crypted remote

If you wish to backup a crypted remote, it it recommended that you use
rclone sync on the encrypted files, and make sure the passwords are the
same in the new encrypted remote.

This will have the following advantages

-   rclone sync will check the checksums while copying
-   you can use rclone check between the encrypted remotes
-   you don’t decrypt and encrypt unnecessarily

For example, let’s say you have your original remote at remote: with the
encrypted version at eremote: with path remote:crypt. You would then set
up the new remote remote2: and then the encrypted version eremote2: with
path remote2:crypt using the same passwords as eremote:.

To sync the two remotes you would do

    rclone sync remote:crypt remote2:crypt

And to check the integrity you would do

    rclone check remote:crypt remote2:crypt


File formats

File encryption

Files are encrypted 1:1 source file to destination object. The file has
a header and is divided into chunks.

Header

-   8 bytes magic string RCLONE\x00\x00
-   24 bytes Nonce (IV)

The initial nonce is generated from the operating systems crypto strong
random number generator. The nonce is incremented for each chunk read
making sure each nonce is unique for each block written. The chance of a
nonce being re-used is minuscule. If you wrote an exabyte of data (10¹⁸
bytes) you would have a probability of approximately 2×10⁻³² of re-using
a nonce.

Chunk

Each chunk will contain 64kB of data, except for the last one which may
have less data. The data chunk is in standard NACL secretbox format.
Secretbox uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and authenticate
messages.

Each chunk contains:

-   16 Bytes of Poly1305 authenticator
-   1 - 65536 bytes XSalsa20 encrypted data

64k chunk size was chosen as the best performing chunk size (the
authenticator takes too much time below this and the performance drops
off due to cache effects above this). Note that these chunks are
buffered in memory so they can’t be too big.

This uses a 32 byte (256 bit key) key derived from the user password.

Examples

1 byte file will encrypt to

-   32 bytes header
-   17 bytes data chunk

49 bytes total

1MB (1048576 bytes) file will encrypt to

-   32 bytes header
-   16 chunks of 65568 bytes

1049120 bytes total (a 0.05% overhead). This is the overhead for big
files.

Name encryption

File names are encrypted segment by segment - the path is broken up into
/ separated strings and these are encrypted individually.

File segments are padded using using PKCS#7 to a multiple of 16 bytes
before encryption.

They are then encrypted with EME using AES with 256 bit key. EME
(ECB-Mix-ECB) is a wide-block encryption mode presented in the 2003
paper “A Parallelizable Enciphering Mode” by Halevi and Rogaway.

This makes for deterministic encryption which is what we want - the same
filename must encrypt to the same thing otherwise we can’t find it on
the cloud storage system.

This means that

-   filenames with the same name will encrypt the same
-   filenames which start the same won’t have a common prefix

This uses a 32 byte key (256 bits) and a 16 byte (128 bits) IV both of
which are derived from the user password.

After encryption they are written out using a modified version of
standard base32 encoding as described in RFC4648. The standard encoding
is modified in two ways:

-   it becomes lower case (no-one likes upper case filenames!)
-   we strip the padding character =

base32 is used rather than the more efficient base64 so rclone can be
used on case insensitive remotes (eg Windows, Amazon Drive).

Key derivation

Rclone uses scrypt with parameters N=16384, r=8, p=1 with an optional
user supplied salt (password2) to derive the 32+32+16 = 80 bytes of key
material required. If the user doesn’t supply a salt then rclone uses an
internal one.

scrypt makes it impractical to mount a dictionary attack on rclone
encrypted data. For full protection against this you should always use a
salt.


Dropbox

Paths are specified as remote:path

Dropbox paths may be as deep as required, eg
remote:directory/subdirectory.

The initial setup for dropbox involves getting a token from Dropbox
which you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks you through
it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    n) New remote
    d) Delete remote
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Dropbox
       \ "dropbox"
    [snip]
    Storage> dropbox
    Dropbox App Key - leave blank normally.
    app_key>
    Dropbox App Secret - leave blank normally.
    app_secret>
    Remote config
    Please visit:
    https://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/authorize?client_id=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&response_type=code
    Enter the code: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX_XXXXXXXXXX
    --------------------
    [remote]
    app_key =
    app_secret =
    token = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX_XXXX_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your dropbox

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your dropbox

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a dropbox directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Dropbox for business

Rclone supports Dropbox for business and Team Folders.

When using Dropbox for business remote: and remote:path/to/file will
refer to your personal folder.

If you wish to see Team Folders you must use a leading / in the path, so
rclone lsd remote:/ will refer to the root and show you all Team Folders
and your User Folder.

You can then use team folders like this remote:/TeamFolder and
remote:/TeamFolder/path/to/file.

A leading / for a Dropbox personal account will do nothing, but it will
take an extra HTTP transaction so it should be avoided.

Modified time and Hashes

Dropbox supports modified times, but the only way to set a modification
time is to re-upload the file.

This means that if you uploaded your data with an older version of
rclone which didn’t support the v2 API and modified times, rclone will
decide to upload all your old data to fix the modification times. If you
don’t want this to happen use --size-only or --checksum flag to stop it.

Dropbox supports its own hash type which is checked for all transfers.

Restricted filename characters

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  NUL          0x00         ␀
  /            0x2F        ／
  DEL          0x7F         ␡
  \            0x5C        ＼

File names can also not end with the following characters. These only
get replaced if they are last character in the name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  SP           0x20         ␠

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in JSON
strings.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to dropbox (Dropbox).

–dropbox-client-id

Dropbox App Client Id Leave blank normally.

-   Config: client_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_CLIENT_ID
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–dropbox-client-secret

Dropbox App Client Secret Leave blank normally.

-   Config: client_secret
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_CLIENT_SECRET
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to dropbox (Dropbox).

–dropbox-chunk-size

Upload chunk size. (< 150M).

Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of this size.

Note that chunks are buffered in memory (one at a time) so rclone can
deal with retries. Setting this larger will increase the speed slightly
(at most 10% for 128MB in tests) at the cost of using more memory. It
can be set smaller if you are tight on memory.

-   Config: chunk_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_CHUNK_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 48M

–dropbox-impersonate

Impersonate this user when using a business account.

-   Config: impersonate
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DROPBOX_IMPERSONATE
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

Limitations

Note that Dropbox is case insensitive so you can’t have a file called
“Hello.doc” and one called “hello.doc”.

There are some file names such as thumbs.db which Dropbox can’t store.
There is a full list of them in the “Ignored Files” section of this
document. Rclone will issue an error message
File name disallowed - not uploading if it attempts to upload one of
those file names, but the sync won’t fail.

If you have more than 10,000 files in a directory then
rclone purge dropbox:dir will return the error
Failed to purge: There are too many files involved in this operation. As
a work-around do an rclone delete dropbox:dir followed by an
rclone rmdir dropbox:dir.


FTP

FTP is the File Transfer Protocol. FTP support is provided using the
github.com/jlaffaye/ftp package.

Here is an example of making an FTP configuration. First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process. An FTP remote
only needs a host together with and a username and a password. With
anonymous FTP server, you will need to use anonymous as username and
your email address as the password.

    [remote]
    type = ftp
    host = ftp.example.com
    pass = *** ENCRYPTED ***
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

This remote is called remote and can now be used like this

See all directories in the home directory

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:path/to/directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:path/to/directory

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote directory, deleting any excess
files in the directory.

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:directory

Modified time

FTP does not support modified times. Any times you see on the server
will be time of upload.

Checksums

FTP does not support any checksums.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

File names can also not end with the following characters. These only
get replaced if they are last character in the name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  SP           0x20         ␠

Note that not all FTP servers can have all characters in file names, for
example:

  FTP Server    Forbidden characters
  ------------ ----------------------
  proftpd                *
  pureftpd             \ [ ]

Implicit TLS

FTP supports implicit FTP over TLS servers (FTPS). This has to be
enabled in the config for the remote. The default FTPS port is 990 so
the port will likely have to be explictly set in the config for the
remote.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to ftp (FTP Connection).

–ftp-host

Maximum number of FTP simultaneous connections, 0 for unlimited

-   Config: concurrency
-   Env Var: RCLONE_FTP_CONCURRENCY
-   Type: int
-   Default: 0

–ftp-no-check-certificate

Do not verify the TLS certificate of the server

-   Config: no_check_certificate
-   Env Var: RCLONE_FTP_NO_CHECK_CERTIFICATE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–ftp-disable-epsv

Disable using EPSV even if server advertises support

-   Config: disable_epsv
-   Env Var: RCLONE_FTP_DISABLE_EPSV
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

Limitations

Note that since FTP isn’t HTTP based the following flags don’t work with
it: --dump-headers, --dump-bodies, --dump-auth

Note that --timeout isn’t supported (but --contimeout is).

Note that --bind isn’t supported.

FTP could support server side move but doesn’t yet.

Note that the ftp backend does not support the ftp_proxy environment
variable yet.

Note that while implicit FTP over TLS is supported, explicit FTP over
TLS is not.


Google Cloud Storage

Paths are specified as remote:bucket (or remote: for the lsd command.)
You may put subdirectories in too, eg remote:bucket/path/to/dir.

The initial setup for google cloud storage involves getting a token from
Google Cloud Storage which you need to do in your browser. rclone config
walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    n) New remote
    d) Delete remote
    q) Quit config

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode. This only
runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code. This is on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it
may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host
firewall, or use manual mode.

This remote is called remote and can now be used like this

See all the buckets in your project

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote bucket, deleting any excess
files in the bucket.

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:bucket

Service Account support

You can set up rclone with Google Cloud Storage in an unattended mode,
i.e. not tied to a specific end-user Google account. This is useful when
you want to synchronise files onto machines that don’t have actively
logged-in users, for example build machines.

To get credentials for Google Cloud Platform IAM Service Accounts,
please head to the Service Account section of the Google Developer
Console. Service Accounts behave just like normal User permissions in
Google Cloud Storage ACLs, so you can limit their access (e.g. make them
read only). After creating an account, a JSON file containing the
Service Account’s credentials will be downloaded onto your machines.
These credentials are what rclone will use for authentication.

To use a Service Account instead of OAuth2 token flow, enter the path to
your Service Account credentials at the service_account_file prompt and
rclone won’t use the browser based authentication flow. If you’d rather
stuff the contents of the credentials file into the rclone config file,
you can set service_account_credentials with the actual contents of the
file instead, or set the equivalent environment variable.

Application Default Credentials

If no other source of credentials is provided, rclone will fall back to
Application Default Credentials this is useful both when you already
have configured authentication for your developer account, or in
production when running on a google compute host. Note that if running
in docker, you may need to run additional commands on your google
compute machine - see this page.

Note that in the case application default credentials are used, there is
no need to explicitly configure a project number.

–fast-list

This remote supports --fast-list which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the rclone docs for more
details.

Modified time

Google google cloud storage stores md5sums natively and rclone stores
modification times as metadata on the object, under the “mtime” key in
RFC3339 format accurate to 1ns.

Restricted filename characters

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  NUL          0x00         ␀
  LF           0x0A         ␊
  CR           0x0D         ␍
  /            0x2F        ／

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in JSON
strings.

Google Drive

Paths are specified as drive:path

Drive paths may be as deep as required, eg drive:directory/subdirectory.

The initial setup for drive involves getting a token from Google drive
which you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks you through
it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config

     3 | These are visible in the drive website.
       | File authorization is revoked when the user deauthorizes the app.
       \ "drive.file"
       / Allows read and write access to the Application Data folder.
     4 | This is not visible in the drive website.
       \ "drive.appfolder"

    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode. This only
runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code. This is on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it
may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host
firewall, or use manual mode.

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your drive

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your drive

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a drive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Scopes

Rclone allows you to select which scope you would like for rclone to
use. This changes what type of token is granted to rclone. The scopes
are defined here..

The scope are

drive

This is the default scope and allows full access to all files, except
for the Application Data Folder (see below).

Choose this one if you aren’t sure.

drive.readonly

This allows read only access to all files. Files may be listed and
downloaded but not uploaded, renamed or deleted.

drive.file

With this scope rclone can read/view/modify only those files and folders
it creates.

So if you uploaded files to drive via the web interface (or any other
means) they will not be visible to rclone.

This can be useful if you are using rclone to backup data and you want
to be sure confidential data on your drive is not visible to rclone.

Files created with this scope are visible in the web interface.

drive.appfolder

This gives rclone its own private area to store files. Rclone will not
be able to see any other files on your drive and you won’t be able to
see rclone’s files from the web interface either.

drive.metadata.readonly

This allows read only access to file names only. It does not allow
rclone to download or upload data, or rename or delete files or
directories.

Root folder ID

You can set the root_folder_id for rclone. This is the directory
(identified by its Folder ID) that rclone considers to be the root of
your drive.

Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the correct
root to use itself.

However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy or to access data within the “Computers” tab on the drive web
interface (where files from Google’s Backup and Sync desktop program
go).

In order to do this you will have to find the Folder ID of the directory
you wish rclone to display. This will be the last segment of the URL
when you open the relevant folder in the drive web interface.

So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh
in the browser, then you use 1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh as the
root_folder_id in the config.

NB folders under the “Computers” tab seem to be read only (drive gives a
500 error) when using rclone.

There doesn’t appear to be an API to discover the folder IDs of the
“Computers” tab - please contact us if you know otherwise!

Note also that rclone can’t access any data under the “Backups” tab on
the google drive web interface yet.

Service Account support

You can set up rclone with Google Drive in an unattended mode, i.e. not
tied to a specific end-user Google account. This is useful when you want
to synchronise files onto machines that don’t have actively logged-in
users, for example build machines.

To use a Service Account instead of OAuth2 token flow, enter the path to
your Service Account credentials at the service_account_file prompt
during rclone config and rclone won’t use the browser based
authentication flow. If you’d rather stuff the contents of the
credentials file into the rclone config file, you can set
service_account_credentials with the actual contents of the file
instead, or set the equivalent environment variable.

Use case - Google Apps/G-suite account and individual Drive

Let’s say that you are the administrator of a Google Apps (old) or
G-suite account. The goal is to store data on an individual’s Drive
account, who IS a member of the domain. We’ll call the domain
EXAMPLE.COM, and the user FOO@EXAMPLE.COM.

There’s a few steps we need to go through to accomplish this:

1. Create a service account for example.com

-   To create a service account and obtain its credentials, go to the
    Google Developer Console.
-   You must have a project - create one if you don’t.
-   Then go to “IAM & admin” -> “Service Accounts”.
-   Use the “Create Credentials” button. Fill in “Service account name”
    with something that identifies your client. “Role” can be empty.
-   Tick “Furnish a new private key” - select “Key type JSON”.
-   Tick “Enable G Suite Domain-wide Delegation”. This option makes
    “impersonation” possible, as documented here: Delegating domain-wide
    authority to the service account
-   These credentials are what rclone will use for authentication. If
    you ever need to remove access, press the “Delete service account
    key” button.

2. Allowing API access to example.com Google Drive

-   Go to example.com’s admin console
-   Go into “Security” (or use the search bar)
-   Select “Show more” and then “Advanced settings”
-   Select “Manage API client access” in the “Authentication” section
-   In the “Client Name” field enter the service account’s “Client ID” -
    this can be found in the Developer Console under “IAM & Admin” ->
    “Service Accounts”, then “View Client ID” for the newly created
    service account. It is a ~21 character numerical string.
-   In the next field, “One or More API Scopes”, enter
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive to grant access to Google
    Drive specifically.

3. Configure rclone, assuming a new install

    rclone config

    n/s/q> n         # New
    name>gdrive      # Gdrive is an example name
    Storage>         # Select the number shown for Google Drive
    client_id>       # Can be left blank
    client_secret>   # Can be left blank
    scope>           # Select your scope, 1 for example
    root_folder_id>  # Can be left blank
    service_account_file> /home/foo/myJSONfile.json # This is where the JSON file goes!
    y/n>             # Auto config, y

4. Verify that it’s working

-   rclone -v --drive-impersonate foo@example.com lsf gdrive:backup
-   The arguments do:
    -   -v - verbose logging
    -   --drive-impersonate foo@example.com - this is what does the
        magic, pretending to be user foo.
    -   lsf - list files in a parsing friendly way
    -   gdrive:backup - use the remote called gdrive, work in the folder
        named backup.

Team drives

If you want to configure the remote to point to a Google Team Drive then
answer y to the question Configure this as a team drive?.

This will fetch the list of Team Drives from google and allow you to
configure which one you want to use. You can also type in a team drive
ID if you prefer.

For example:

    Configure this as a team drive?

–fast-list

This remote supports --fast-list which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the rclone docs for more
details.

It does this by combining multiple list calls into a single API request.

This works by combining many '%s' in parents filters into one
expression. To list the contents of directories a, b and c, the
following requests will be send by the regular List function:

    trashed=false and 'a' in parents
    trashed=false and 'b' in parents
    trashed=false and 'c' in parents

These can now be combined into a single request:

    trashed=false and ('a' in parents or 'b' in parents or 'c' in parents)

The implementation of ListR will put up to 50 parents filters into one
request. It will use the --checkers value to specify the number of
requests to run in parallel.

In tests, these batch requests were up to 20x faster than the regular
method. Running the following command against different sized folders
gives:

    rclone lsjson -vv -R --checkers=6 gdrive:folder

small folder (220 directories, 700 files):

-   without --fast-list: 38s
-   with --fast-list: 10s

large folder (10600 directories, 39000 files):

-   without --fast-list: 22:05 min
-   with --fast-list: 58s

Modified time

Google drive stores modification times accurate to 1 ms.

Restricted filename characters

Only Invalid UTF-8 bytes will be replaced, as they can’t be used in JSON
strings.

In contrast to other backends, / can also be used in names and . or ..
are valid names.

Revisions

Google drive stores revisions of files. When you upload a change to an
existing file to google drive using rclone it will create a new revision
of that file.

Revisions follow the standard google policy which at time of writing was

-   They are deleted after 30 days or 100 revisions (whatever comes
    first).
-   They do not count towards a user storage quota.

Deleting files

By default rclone will send all files to the trash when deleting files.
If deleting them permanently is required then use the
--drive-use-trash=false flag, or set the equivalent environment
variable.

Emptying trash

If you wish to empty your trash you can use the rclone cleanup remote:
command which will permanently delete all your trashed files. This
command does not take any path arguments.

Note that Google Drive takes some time (minutes to days) to empty the
trash even though the command returns within a few seconds. No output is
echoed, so there will be no confirmation even using -v or -vv.

Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the rclone about remote: command
which will display your usage limit (quota), the usage in Google Drive,
the size of all files in the Trash and the space used by other Google
services such as Gmail. This command does not take any path arguments.

Import/Export of google documents

Google documents can be exported from and uploaded to Google Drive.

When rclone downloads a Google doc it chooses a format to download
depending upon the --drive-export-formats setting. By default the export
formats are docx,xlsx,pptx,svg which are a sensible default for an
editable document.

When choosing a format, rclone runs down the list provided in order and
chooses the first file format the doc can be exported as from the list.
If the file can’t be exported to a format on the formats list, then
rclone will choose a format from the default list.

If you prefer an archive copy then you might use
--drive-export-formats pdf, or if you prefer openoffice/libreoffice
formats you might use --drive-export-formats ods,odt,odp.

Note that rclone adds the extension to the google doc, so if it is
called My Spreadsheet on google docs, it will be exported as
My Spreadsheet.xlsx or My Spreadsheet.pdf etc.

When importing files into Google Drive, rclone will convert all files
with an extension in --drive-import-formats to their associated document
type. rclone will not convert any files by default, since the conversion
is lossy process.

The conversion must result in a file with the same extension when the
--drive-export-formats rules are applied to the uploaded document.

Here are some examples for allowed and prohibited conversions.

  export-formats   import-formats   Upload Ext   Document Ext   Allowed
  ---------------- ---------------- ------------ -------------- ---------
  odt              odt              odt          odt            Yes
  odt              docx,odt         odt          odt            Yes
                   docx             docx         docx           Yes
                   odt              odt          docx           No
  odt,docx         docx,odt         docx         odt            No
  docx,odt         docx,odt         docx         docx           Yes
  docx,odt         docx,odt         odt          docx           No

This limitation can be disabled by specifying
--drive-allow-import-name-change. When using this flag, rclone can
convert multiple files types resulting in the same document type at
once, eg with --drive-import-formats docx,odt,txt, all files having
these extension would result in a document represented as a docx file.
This brings the additional risk of overwriting a document, if multiple
files have the same stem. Many rclone operations will not handle this
name change in any way. They assume an equal name when copying files and
might copy the file again or delete them when the name changes.

Here are the possible export extensions with their corresponding mime
types. Most of these can also be used for importing, but there more that
are not listed here. Some of these additional ones might only be
available when the operating system provides the correct MIME type
entries.

This list can be changed by Google Drive at any time and might not
represent the currently available conversions.

Google documents can also be exported as link files. These files will
open a browser window for the Google Docs website of that document when
opened. The link file extension has to be specified as a
--drive-export-formats parameter. They will match all available Google
Documents.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to drive (Google Drive).

–drive-client-id

Google Application Client Id Setting your own is recommended. See
https://rclone.org/drive/#making-your-own-client-id for how to create
your own. If you leave this blank, it will use an internal key which is
low performance.

-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_CLIENT_ID
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–drive-client-secret

Google Application Client Secret Setting your own is recommended.

        -   Allows read-only access to file metadata but
        -   does not allow any access to read or download file content.

–drive-root-folder-id

ID of the root folder Leave blank normally.

Fill in to access “Computers” folders (see docs), or for rclone to use a
non root folder as its starting point.

Note that if this is blank, the first time rclone runs it will fill it
in with the ID of the root folder.

-   Config: root_folder_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–drive-service-account-file

ID of the Team Drive

-   Config: team_drive
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_TEAM_DRIVE
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–drive-auth-owner-only

Only consider files owned by the authenticated user.

-   Config: auth_owner_only
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_AUTH_OWNER_ONLY
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–drive-use-trash

Send files to the trash instead of deleting permanently. Defaults to
true, namely sending files to the trash. Use --drive-use-trash=false to
delete files permanently instead.

-   Config: use_trash
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_TRASH
-   Type: bool
-   Default: true

–drive-skip-gdocs

Skip google documents in all listings. If given, gdocs practically
become invisible to rclone.

-   Config: skip_gdocs
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_SKIP_GDOCS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–drive-skip-checksum-gphotos

Skip MD5 checksum on Google photos and videos only.

Use this if you get checksum errors when transferring Google photos or
videos.

Setting this flag will cause Google photos and videos to return a blank
MD5 checksum.

Google photos are identifed by being in the “photos” space.

Corrupted checksums are caused by Google modifying the image/video but
not updating the checksum.

-   Config: skip_checksum_gphotos
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_SKIP_CHECKSUM_GPHOTOS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–drive-shared-with-me

Only show files that are shared with me.

Instructs rclone to operate on your “Shared with me” folder (where
Google Drive lets you access the files and folders others have shared
with you).

This works both with the “list” (lsd, lsl, etc) and the “copy” commands
(copy, sync, etc), and with all other commands too.

-   Config: shared_with_me
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_SHARED_WITH_ME
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–drive-trashed-only

Only show files that are in the trash. This will show trashed files in
their original directory structure.

-   Config: trashed_only
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_TRASHED_ONLY
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–drive-formats

Deprecated: see export_formats

-   Config: formats
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_FORMATS
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–drive-export-formats

Comma separated list of preferred formats for downloading Google docs.

-   Config: export_formats
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_EXPORT_FORMATS
-   Type: string
-   Default: “docx,xlsx,pptx,svg”

–drive-import-formats

Comma separated list of preferred formats for uploading Google docs.

-   Config: import_formats
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_IMPORT_FORMATS
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–drive-allow-import-name-change

Allow the filetype to change when uploading Google docs (e.g. file.doc
to file.docx). This will confuse sync and reupload every time.

-   Config: allow_import_name_change
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_ALLOW_IMPORT_NAME_CHANGE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–drive-use-created-date

Use file created date instead of modified date.,

Useful when downloading data and you want the creation date used in
place of the last modified date.

WARNING: This flag may have some unexpected consequences.

When uploading to your drive all files will be overwritten unless they
haven’t been modified since their creation. And the inverse will occur
while downloading. This side effect can be avoided by using the
“–checksum” flag.

This feature was implemented to retain photos capture date as recorded
by google photos. You will first need to check the “Create a Google
Photos folder” option in your google drive settings. You can then copy
or move the photos locally and use the date the image was taken
(created) set as the modification date.

-   Config: use_created_date
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_CREATED_DATE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–drive-list-chunk

Size of listing chunk 100-1000. 0 to disable.

-   Config: list_chunk
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_LIST_CHUNK
-   Type: int
-   Default: 1000

–drive-impersonate

Impersonate this user when using a service account.

-   Config: impersonate
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_IMPERSONATE
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–drive-alternate-export

Use alternate export URLs for google documents export.,

If this option is set this instructs rclone to use an alternate set of
export URLs for drive documents. Users have reported that the official
export URLs can’t export large documents, whereas these unofficial ones
can.

See rclone issue #2243 for background, this google drive issue and this
helpful post.

-   Config: alternate_export
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_ALTERNATE_EXPORT
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–drive-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload

-   Config: upload_cutoff
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 8M

–drive-chunk-size

Upload chunk size. Must a power of 2 >= 256k.

Making this larger will improve performance, but note that each chunk is
buffered in memory one per transfer.

Reducing this will reduce memory usage but decrease performance.

-   Config: chunk_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_CHUNK_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 8M

–drive-acknowledge-abuse

Set to allow files which return cannotDownloadAbusiveFile to be
downloaded.

If downloading a file returns the error “This file has been identified
as malware or spam and cannot be downloaded” with the error code
“cannotDownloadAbusiveFile” then supply this flag to rclone to indicate
you acknowledge the risks of downloading the file and rclone will
download it anyway.

-   Config: acknowledge_abuse
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_ACKNOWLEDGE_ABUSE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–drive-keep-revision-forever

Keep new head revision of each file forever.

-   Config: keep_revision_forever
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_KEEP_REVISION_FOREVER
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–drive-size-as-quota

Show storage quota usage for file size.

The storage used by a file is the size of the current version plus any
older versions that have been set to keep forever.

-   Config: size_as_quota
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_SIZE_AS_QUOTA
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–drive-v2-download-min-size

If Object’s are greater, use drive v2 API to download.

-   Config: v2_download_min_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_V2_DOWNLOAD_MIN_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: off

–drive-pacer-min-sleep

Minimum time to sleep between API calls.

-   Config: pacer_min_sleep
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_PACER_MIN_SLEEP
-   Type: Duration
-   Default: 100ms

–drive-pacer-burst

Number of API calls to allow without sleeping.

-   Config: pacer_burst
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_PACER_BURST
-   Type: int
-   Default: 100

–drive-server-side-across-configs

Allow server side operations (eg copy) to work across different drive
configs.

This can be useful if you wish to do a server side copy between two
different Google drives. Note that this isn’t enabled by default because
it isn’t easy to tell if it will work between any two configurations.

-   Config: server_side_across_configs
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_SERVER_SIDE_ACROSS_CONFIGS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–drive-disable-http2

Disable drive using http2

There is currently an unsolved issue with the google drive backend and
HTTP/2. HTTP/2 is therefore disabled by default for the drive backend
but can be re-enabled here. When the issue is solved this flag will be
removed.

See: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3631

-   Config: disable_http2
-   Env Var: RCLONE_DRIVE_DISABLE_HTTP2
-   Type: bool
-   Default: true

Limitations

Drive has quite a lot of rate limiting. This causes rclone to be limited
to transferring about 2 files per second only. Individual files may be
transferred much faster at 100s of MBytes/s but lots of small files can
take a long time.

Server side copies are also subject to a separate rate limit. If you see
User rate limit exceeded errors, wait at least 24 hours and retry. You
can disable server side copies with --disable copy to download and
upload the files if you prefer.

Limitations of Google Docs

Google docs will appear as size -1 in rclone ls and as size 0 in
anything which uses the VFS layer, eg rclone mount, rclone serve.

This is because rclone can’t find out the size of the Google docs
without downloading them.

Google docs will transfer correctly with rclone sync, rclone copy etc as
rclone knows to ignore the size when doing the transfer.

However an unfortunate consequence of this is that you may not be able
to download Google docs using rclone mount. If it doesn’t work you will
get a 0 sized file. If you try again the doc may gain its correct size
and be downloadable. Whther it will work on not depends on the
application accessing the mount and the OS you are running - experiment
to find out if it does work for you!

Duplicated files

Sometimes, for no reason I’ve been able to track down, drive will
duplicate a file that rclone uploads. Drive unlike all the other remotes
can have duplicated files.

Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.

Use rclone dedupe to fix duplicated files.

Note that this isn’t just a problem with rclone, even Google Photos on
Android duplicates files on drive sometimes.

Rclone appears to be re-copying files it shouldn’t

The most likely cause of this is the duplicated file issue above - run
rclone dedupe and check your logs for duplicate object or directory
messages.

This can also be caused by a delay/caching on google drive’s end when
comparing directory listings. Specifically with team drives used in
combination with –fast-list. Files that were uploaded recently may not
appear on the directory list sent to rclone when using –fast-list.

Waiting a moderate period of time between attempts (estimated to be
approximately 1 hour) and/or not using –fast-list both seem to be
effective in preventing the problem.

Making your own client_id

When you use rclone with Google drive in its default configuration you
are using rclone’s client_id. This is shared between all the rclone
users. There is a global rate limit on the number of queries per second
that each client_id can do set by Google. rclone already has a high
quota and I will continue to make sure it is high enough by contacting
Google.

It is strongly recommended to use your own client ID as the default
rclone ID is heavily used. If you have multiple services running, it is
recommended to use an API key for each service. The default Google quota
is 10 transactions per second so it is recommended to stay under that
number as if you use more than that, it will cause rclone to rate limit
and make things slower.

Here is how to create your own Google Drive client ID for rclone:

1.  Log into the Google API Console with your Google account. It doesn’t
    matter what Google account you use. (It need not be the same account
    as the Google Drive you want to access)

2.  Select a project or create a new project.

3.  Under “ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES” search for “Drive”, and enable the
    “Google Drive API”.

4.  Click “Credentials” in the left-side panel (not “Create
    credentials”, which opens the wizard), then “Create credentials”,
    then “OAuth client ID”. It will prompt you to set the OAuth consent
    screen product name, if you haven’t set one already.

5.  Choose an application type of “other”, and click “Create”. (the
    default name is fine)

6.  It will show you a client ID and client secret. Use these values in
    rclone config to add a new remote or edit an existing remote.

Google Photos

The rclone backend for Google Photos is a specialized backend for
transferring photos and videos to and from Google Photos.

NB The Google Photos API which rclone uses has quite a few limitations,
so please read the limitations section carefully to make sure it is
suitable for your use.


Configuring Google Photos

The initial setup for google cloud storage involves getting a token from
Google Photos which you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks
you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Google Photos
       \ "google photos"
    [snip]
    Storage> google photos
    ** See help for google photos backend at: https://rclone.org/googlephotos/ **

    Google Application Client Id
    Leave blank normally.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    client_id> 
    Google Application Client Secret
    Leave blank normally.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    client_secret> 
    Set to make the Google Photos backend read only.

    If you choose read only then rclone will only request read only access
    to your photos, otherwise rclone will request full access.
    Enter a boolean value (true or false). Press Enter for the default ("false").
    read_only> 
    Edit advanced config? (y/n)
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> n
    Remote config
    Use auto config?
     * Say Y if not sure
     * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> y
    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code

    *** IMPORTANT: All media items uploaded to Google Photos with rclone
    *** are stored in full resolution at original quality.  These uploads
    *** will count towards storage in your Google Account.

    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = google photos
    token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"Bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"2019-06-28T17:38:04.644930156+01:00"}
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode. This only
runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code. This is on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this may
require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host
firewall, or use manual mode.

This remote is called remote and can now be used like this

See all the albums in your photos

    rclone lsd remote:album

Make a new album

    rclone mkdir remote:album/newAlbum

List the contents of an album

    rclone ls remote:album/newAlbum

Sync /home/local/images to the Google Photos, removing any excess files
in the album.

    rclone sync /home/local/image remote:album/newAlbum


Layout

As Google Photos is not a general purpose cloud storage system the
backend is laid out to help you navigate it.

The directories under media show different ways of categorizing the
media. Each file will appear multiple times. So if you want to make a
backup of your google photos you might choose to backup
remote:media/by-month. (NB remote:media/by-day is rather slow at the
moment so avoid for syncing.)

Note that all your photos and videos will appear somewhere under media,
but they may not appear under album unless you’ve put them into albums.

    - album
        - album name
        - album name/sub
    - shared-album
        - album name
        - album name/sub

There are two writable parts of the tree, the upload directory and sub
directories of the the album directory.

The upload directory is for uploading files you don’t want to put into
albums. This will be empty to start with and will contain the files
you’ve uploaded for one rclone session only, becoming empty again when
you restart rclone. The use case for this would be if you have a load of
files you just want to once off dump into Google Photos. For repeated
syncing, uploading to album will work better.

Directories within the album directory are also writeable and you may
create new directories (albums) under album. If you copy files with a
directory hierarchy in there then rclone will create albums with the /
character in them. For example if you do

    rclone copy /path/to/images remote:album/images

and the images directory contains

    images
        - file1.jpg
        dir
            file2.jpg
        dir2
            dir3
                file3.jpg

Then rclone will create the following albums with the following files in

-   images
    -   file1.jpg
-   images/dir
    -   file2.jpg
-   images/dir2/dir3
    -   file3.jpg

This means that you can use the album path pretty much like a normal
filesystem and it is a good target for repeated syncing.

The shared-album directory shows albums shared with you or by you. This
is similar to the Sharing tab in the Google Photos web interface.


Limitations

Only images and videos can be uploaded. If you attempt to upload non
videos or images or formats that Google Photos doesn’t understand,
rclone will upload the file, then Google Photos will give an error when
it is put turned into a media item.

Note that all media items uploaded to Google Photos through the API are
stored in full resolution at “original quality” and WILL count towards
your storage quota in your Google Account. The API does NOT offer a way
to upload in “high quality” mode..

Downloading Images

When Images are downloaded this strips EXIF location (according to the
docs and my tests). This is a limitation of the Google Photos API and is
covered by bug #112096115.

THE CURRENT GOOGLE API DOES NOT ALLOW PHOTOS TO BE DOWNLOADED AT
ORIGINAL RESOLUTION. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT IF YOU ARE, FOR EXAMPLE,
RELYING ON “GOOGLE PHOTOS” AS A BACKUP OF YOUR PHOTOS. YOU WILL NOT BE
ABLE TO USE RCLONE TO REDOWNLOAD ORIGINAL IMAGES. YOU COULD USE ‘GOOGLE
TAKEOUT’ TO RECOVER THE ORIGINAL PHOTOS AS A LAST RESORT

Downloading Videos

When videos are downloaded they are downloaded in a really compressed
version of the video compared to downloading it via the Google Photos
web interface. This is covered by bug #113672044.

Duplicates

If a file name is duplicated in a directory then rclone will add the
file ID into its name. So two files called file.jpg would then appear as
file {123456}.jpg and file {ABCDEF}.jpg (the actual IDs are a lot longer
alas!).

If you upload the same image (with the same binary data) twice then
Google Photos will deduplicate it. However it will retain the filename
from the first upload which may confuse rclone. For example if you
uploaded an image to upload then uploaded the same image to
album/my_album the filename of the image in album/my_album will be what
it was uploaded with initially, not what you uploaded it with to album.
In practise this shouldn’t cause too many problems.

Modified time

The date shown of media in Google Photos is the creation date as
determined by the EXIF information, or the upload date if that is not
known.

This is not changeable by rclone and is not the modification date of the
media on local disk. This means that rclone cannot use the dates from
Google Photos for syncing purposes.

Size

The Google Photos API does not return the size of media. This means that
when syncing to Google Photos, rclone can only do a file existence
check.

It is possible to read the size of the media, but this needs an extra
HTTP HEAD request per media item so is VERY SLOW and uses up a lot of
transactions. This can be enabled with the --gphotos-read-size option or
the read_size = true config parameter.

If you want to use the backend with rclone mount you may need to enable
this flag (depending on your OS and application using the photos)
otherwise you may not be able to read media off the mount. You’ll need
to experiment to see if it works for you without the flag.

Albums

Rclone can only upload files to albums it created. This is a limitation
of the Google Photos API.

Rclone can remove files it uploaded from albums it created only.

Deleting files

Rclone can remove files from albums it created, but note that the Google
Photos API does not allow media to be deleted permanently so this media
will still remain. See bug #109759781.

Rclone cannot delete files anywhere except under album.

Deleting albums

The Google Photos API does not support deleting albums - see bug
#135714733.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to google photos (Google Photos).

–gphotos-client-id

Google Application Client Id Leave blank normally.

-   Config: client_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_CLIENT_ID
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–gphotos-client-secret

Google Application Client Secret Leave blank normally.

-   Config: client_secret
-   Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_CLIENT_SECRET
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–gphotos-read-only

Set to make the Google Photos backend read only.

If you choose read only then rclone will only request read only access
to your photos, otherwise rclone will request full access.

-   Config: read_only
-   Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_READ_ONLY
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to google photos (Google Photos).

–gphotos-read-size

Set to read the size of media items.

Normally rclone does not read the size of media items since this takes
another transaction. This isn’t necessary for syncing. However rclone
mount needs to know the size of files in advance of reading them, so
setting this flag when using rclone mount is recommended if you want to
read the media.

-   Config: read_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_GPHOTOS_READ_SIZE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false


HTTP

The HTTP remote is a read only remote for reading files of a webserver.
The webserver should provide file listings which rclone will read and
turn into a remote. This has been tested with common webservers such as
Apache/Nginx/Caddy and will likely work with file listings from most web
servers. (If it doesn’t then please file an issue, or send a pull
request!)

Paths are specified as remote: or remote:path/to/dir.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / http Connection
       \ "http"
    [snip]
    Storage> http
    URL of http host to connect to
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
     1 / Connect to example.com
       \ "https://example.com"
    url> https://beta.rclone.org
    Remote config
    --------------------
    [remote]
    url = https://beta.rclone.org
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y
    Current remotes:

    Name                 Type
    ====                 ====
    remote               http

    e) Edit existing remote
    n) New remote
    d) Delete remote
    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q

This remote is called remote and can now be used like this

See all the top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync the remote directory to /home/local/directory, deleting any excess
files.

    rclone sync remote:directory /home/local/directory

Read only

This remote is read only - you can’t upload files to an HTTP server.

Modified time

Most HTTP servers store time accurate to 1 second.

Checksum

No checksums are stored.

Usage without a config file

Since the http remote only has one config parameter it is easy to use
without a config file:

    rclone lsd --http-url https://beta.rclone.org :http:

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to http (http Connection).

–http-url

URL of http host to connect to

-   Config: url
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HTTP_URL
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""
-   Examples:
    -   “https://example.com”
        -   Connect to example.com
    -   “https://user:pass@example.com”
        -   Connect to example.com using a username and password

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to http (http Connection).

–http-headers

Set HTTP headers for all transactions

Use this to set additional HTTP headers for all transactions

The input format is comma separated list of key,value pairs. Standard
CSV encoding may be used.

For example to set a Cookie use ‘Cookie,name=value’, or
‘“Cookie”,“name=value”’.

You can set multiple headers, eg
‘“Cookie”,“name=value”,“Authorization”,“xxx”’.

-   Config: headers
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HTTP_HEADERS
-   Type: CommaSepList
-   Default:

–http-no-slash

Set this if the site doesn’t end directories with /

Use this if your target website does not use / on the end of
directories.

A / on the end of a path is how rclone normally tells the difference
between files and directories. If this flag is set, then rclone will
treat all files with Content-Type: text/html as directories and read
URLs from them rather than downloading them.

Note that this may cause rclone to confuse genuine HTML files with
directories.

-   Config: no_slash
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HTTP_NO_SLASH
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–http-no-head

Don’t use HEAD requests to find file sizes in dir listing

If your site is being very slow to load then you can try this option.
Normally rclone does a HEAD request for each potential file in a
directory listing to:

-   find its size
-   check it really exists
-   check to see if it is a directory

If you set this option, rclone will not do the HEAD request. This will
mean

-   directory listings are much quicker
-   rclone won’t have the times or sizes of any files
-   some files that don’t exist may be in the listing

-   Config: no_head
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HTTP_NO_HEAD
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false


Hubic

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths are specified as remote:container (or remote: for the lsd
command.) You may put subdirectories in too, eg
remote:container/path/to/dir.

The initial setup for Hubic involves getting a token from Hubic which
you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    n/s> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Hubic
       \ "hubic"
    [snip]
    Storage> hubic
    Hubic Client Id - leave blank normally.
    client_id>
    Hubic Client Secret - leave blank normally.
    client_secret>
    Remote config
    Use auto config?
     * Say Y if not sure
     * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> y
    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    --------------------
    [remote]
    client_id =
    client_secret =
    token = {"access_token":"XXXXXX"}
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

See the remote setup docs for how to set it up on a machine with no
Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Hubic. This only runs from the moment it opens
your browser to the moment you get back the verification code. This is
on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it may require you to unblock it
temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List containers in the top level of your Hubic

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Hubic

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Hubic directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

If you want the directory to be visible in the official _Hubic browser_,
you need to copy your files to the default directory

    rclone copy /home/source remote:default/backup

–fast-list

This remote supports --fast-list which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the rclone docs for more
details.

Modified time

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
X-Object-Meta-Mtime as floating point since the epoch accurate to 1 ns.

This is a de facto standard (used in the official python-swiftclient
amongst others) for storing the modification time for an object.

Note that Hubic wraps the Swift backend, so most of the properties of
are the same.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to hubic (Hubic).

–hubic-client-id

Hubic Client Id Leave blank normally.

-   Config: client_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HUBIC_CLIENT_ID
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–hubic-client-secret

Hubic Client Secret Leave blank normally.

-   Config: client_secret
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HUBIC_CLIENT_SECRET
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to hubic (Hubic).

–hubic-chunk-size

Above this size files will be chunked into a _segments container.

Above this size files will be chunked into a _segments container. The
default for this is 5GB which is its maximum value.

-   Config: chunk_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HUBIC_CHUNK_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 5G

–hubic-no-chunk

Don’t chunk files during streaming upload.

When doing streaming uploads (eg using rcat or mount) setting this flag
will cause the swift backend to not upload chunked files.

This will limit the maximum upload size to 5GB. However non chunked
files are easier to deal with and have an MD5SUM.

Rclone will still chunk files bigger than chunk_size when doing normal
copy operations.

-   Config: no_chunk
-   Env Var: RCLONE_HUBIC_NO_CHUNK
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

Limitations

This uses the normal OpenStack Swift mechanism to refresh the Swift API
credentials and ignores the expires field returned by the Hubic API.

The Swift API doesn’t return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files
(Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won’t check or use the
MD5SUM for these.


Jottacloud

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, eg remote:directory/subdirectory.

To configure Jottacloud you will need to enter your username and
password and select a mountpoint.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

The official Jottacloud client registers a device for each computer you
install it on and then creates a mountpoint for each folder you select
for Backup. The web interface uses a special device called Jotta for the
Archive, Sync and Shared mountpoints. In most cases you’ll want to use
the Jotta/Archive device/mounpoint however if you want to access files
uploaded by the official rclone provides the option to select other
devices and mountpoints during config.

–fast-list

This remote supports --fast-list which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the rclone docs for more
details.

Note that the implementation in Jottacloud always uses only a single API
request to get the entire list, so for large folders this could lead to
long wait time before the first results are shown.

Modified time and hashes

Jottacloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

Jottacloud supports MD5 type hashes, so you can use the --checksum flag.

Note that Jottacloud requires the MD5 hash before upload so if the
source does not have an MD5 checksum then the file will be cached
temporarily on disk (wherever the TMPDIR environment variable points to)
before it is uploaded. Small files will be cached in memory - see the
--jottacloud-md5-memory-limit flag.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  "            0x22        ＂
  *            0x2A        ＊
  :            0x3A        ：
  <            0x3C        ＜
  >            0x3E        ＞
  ?            0x3F        ？
  |            0x7C        ｜

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in XML
strings.

Deleting files

By default rclone will send all files to the trash when deleting files.
Due to a lack of API documentation emptying the trash is currently only
possible via the Jottacloud website. If deleting permanently is required
then use the --jottacloud-hard-delete flag, or set the equivalent
environment variable.

Versions

Jottacloud supports file versioning. When rclone uploads a new version
of a file it creates a new version of it. Currently rclone only supports
retrieving the current version but older versions can be accessed via
the Jottacloud Website.

Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the rclone about remote: command
which will display your usage limit (unless it is unlimited) and the
current usage.

Device IDs

Jottacloud requires each ‘device’ to be registered. Rclone brings such a
registration to easily access your account but if you want to use
Jottacloud together with rclone on multiple machines you NEED to create
a seperate deviceID/deviceSecrect on each machine. You will asked during
setting up the remote. Please be aware that this also means that copying
the rclone config from one machine to another does NOT work with
Jottacloud accounts. You have to create it on each machine.

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to jottacloud (JottaCloud).

–jottacloud-md5-memory-limit

Files bigger than this will be cached on disk to calculate the MD5 if
required.

-   Config: md5_memory_limit
-   Env Var: RCLONE_JOTTACLOUD_MD5_MEMORY_LIMIT
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 10M

–jottacloud-hard-delete

Delete files permanently rather than putting them into the trash.

-   Config: hard_delete
-   Env Var: RCLONE_JOTTACLOUD_HARD_DELETE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–jottacloud-unlink

Remove existing public link to file/folder with link command rather than
creating. Default is false, meaning link command will create or retrieve
public link.

-   Config: unlink
-   Env Var: RCLONE_JOTTACLOUD_UNLINK
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–jottacloud-upload-resume-limit

Files bigger than this can be resumed if the upload fail’s.

-   Config: upload_resume_limit
-   Env Var: RCLONE_JOTTACLOUD_UPLOAD_RESUME_LIMIT
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 10M

Limitations

Note that Jottacloud is case insensitive so you can’t have a file called
“Hello.doc” and one called “hello.doc”.

There are quite a few characters that can’t be in Jottacloud file names.
Rclone will map these names to and from an identical looking unicode
equivalent. For example if a file has a ? in it will be mapped to ？
instead.

Jottacloud only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.

Troubleshooting

Jottacloud exhibits some inconsistent behaviours regarding deleted files
and folders which may cause Copy, Move and DirMove operations to
previously deleted paths to fail. Emptying the trash should help in such
cases.


Koofr

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, eg remote:directory/subdirectory.

The initial setup for Koofr involves creating an application password
for rclone. You can do that by opening the Koofr web application, giving
the password a nice name like rclone and clicking on generate.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called koofr. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> koofr 
    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Koofr
       \ "koofr"
    [snip]
    Storage> koofr
    ** See help for koofr backend at: https://rclone.org/koofr/ **

    Your Koofr user name
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    user> USER@NAME
    Your Koofr password for rclone (generate one at https://app.koofr.net/app/admin/preferences/password)
    y) Yes type in my own password
    g) Generate random password
    y/g> y
    Enter the password:
    password:
    Confirm the password:
    password:
    Edit advanced config? (y/n)
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> n
    Remote config
    --------------------
    [koofr]
    type = koofr
    baseurl = https://app.koofr.net
    user = USER@NAME
    password = *** ENCRYPTED ***
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

You can choose to edit advanced config in order to enter your own
service URL if you use an on-premise or white label Koofr instance, or
choose an alternative mount instead of your primary storage.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your Koofr

    rclone lsd koofr:

List all the files in your Koofr

    rclone ls koofr:

To copy a local directory to an Koofr directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  \            0x5C        ＼

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in XML
strings.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to koofr (Koofr).

–koofr-user

Mount ID of the mount to use. If omitted, the primary mount is used.

-   Config: mountid
-   Env Var: RCLONE_KOOFR_MOUNTID
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–koofr-setmtime

Does the backend support setting modification time. Set this to false if
you use a mount ID that points to a Dropbox or Amazon Drive backend.

-   Config: setmtime
-   Env Var: RCLONE_KOOFR_SETMTIME
-   Type: bool
-   Default: true

Limitations

Note that Koofr is case insensitive so you can’t have a file called
“Hello.doc” and one called “hello.doc”.


Mail.ru Cloud

Mail.ru Cloud is a cloud storage provided by a Russian internet company
Mail.Ru Group. The official desktop client is Disk-O:, available only on
Windows. (Please note that official sites are in Russian)

Features highlights

-   Paths may be as deep as required, eg remote:directory/subdirectory
-   Files have a last modified time property, directories don’t
-   Deleted files are by default moved to the trash
-   Files and directories can be shared via public links
-   Partial uploads or streaming are not supported, file size must be
    known before upload
-   Maximum file size is limited to 2G for a free acount, unlimited for
    paid accounts
-   Storage keeps hash for all files and performs transparent
    deduplication, the hash algorithm is a modified SHA1
-   If a particular file is already present in storage, one can quickly
    submit file hash instead of long file upload (this optimization is
    supported by rclone)

Configuration

Here is an example of making a mailru configuration. First create a
Mail.ru Cloud account and choose a tariff, then run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Mail.ru Cloud
       \ "mailru"
    [snip]
    Storage> mailru
    User name (usually email)
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    user> username@mail.ru
    Password
    y) Yes type in my own password
    g) Generate random password
    y/g> y
    Enter the password:
    password:
    Confirm the password:
    password:
    Skip full upload if there is another file with same data hash.
    This feature is called "speedup" or "put by hash". It is especially efficient
    in case of generally available files like popular books, video or audio clips
    [snip]
    Enter a boolean value (true or false). Press Enter for the default ("true").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
     1 / Enable
       \ "true"
     2 / Disable
       \ "false"
    speedup_enable> 1
    Edit advanced config? (y/n)
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> n
    Remote config
    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = mailru
    user = username@mail.ru
    pass = *** ENCRYPTED ***
    speedup_enable = true
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

Configuration of this backend does not require a local web browser. You
can use the configured backend as shown below:

See top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote path, deleting any excess files
in the path.

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:directory

Modified time

Files support a modification time attribute with up to 1 second
precision. Directories do not have a modification time, which is shown
as “Jan 1 1970”.

Hash checksums

Hash sums use a custom Mail.ru algorithm based on SHA1. If file size is
less than or equal to the SHA1 block size (20 bytes), its hash is simply
its data right-padded with zero bytes. Hash sum of a larger file is
computed as a SHA1 sum of the file data bytes concatenated with a
decimal representation of the data length.

Emptying Trash

Removing a file or directory actually moves it to the trash, which is
not visible to rclone but can be seen in a web browser. The trashed file
still occupies part of total quota. If you wish to empty your trash and
free some quota, you can use the rclone cleanup remote: command, which
will permanently delete all your trashed files. This command does not
take any path arguments.

Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the rclone about remote: command
which will display your usage limit (quota) and the current usage.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  "            0x22        ＂
  *            0x2A        ＊
  :            0x3A        ：
  <            0x3C        ＜
  >            0x3E        ＞
  ?            0x3F        ？
  \            0x5C        ＼
  |            0x7C        ｜

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in JSON
strings.

Limitations

File size limits depend on your account. A single file size is limited
by 2G for a free account and unlimited for paid tariffs. Please refer to
the Mail.ru site for the total uploaded size limits.

Note that Mailru is case insensitive so you can’t have a file called
“Hello.doc” and one called “hello.doc”.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to mailru (Mail.ru Cloud).

–mailru-user

User name (usually email)

-   Config: user
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MAILRU_USER
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–mailru-pass

Password

-   Config: pass
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MAILRU_PASS
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–mailru-speedup-enable

Skip full upload if there is another file with same data hash. This
feature is called “speedup” or “put by hash”. It is especially efficient
in case of generally available files like popular books, video or audio
clips, because files are searched by hash in all accounts of all mailru
users. Please note that rclone may need local memory and disk space to
calculate content hash in advance and decide whether full upload is
required. Also, if rclone does not know file size in advance (e.g. in
case of streaming or partial uploads), it will not even try this
optimization.

-   Config: speedup_enable
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MAILRU_SPEEDUP_ENABLE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: true
-   Examples:
    -   “true”
        -   Enable
    -   “false”
        -   Disable

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to mailru (Mail.ru Cloud).

–mailru-speedup-file-patterns

Comma separated list of file name patterns eligible for speedup (put by
hash). Patterns are case insensitive and can contain ’*’ or ‘?’ meta
characters.

-   Config: speedup_file_patterns
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MAILRU_SPEEDUP_FILE_PATTERNS
-   Type: string
-   Default: “_.mkv,_.avi,_.mp4,_.mp3,_.zip,_.gz,_.rar,_.pdf”
-   Examples:
    -   ""
        -   Empty list completely disables speedup (put by hash).
    -   "*"
        -   All files will be attempted for speedup.
    -   “_.mkv,_.avi,_.mp4,_.mp3”
        -   Only common audio/video files will be tried for put by hash.
    -   “_.zip,_.gz,_.rar,_.pdf”
        -   Only common archives or PDF books will be tried for speedup.

–mailru-speedup-max-disk

This option allows you to disable speedup (put by hash) for large files
(because preliminary hashing can exhaust you RAM or disk space)

-   Config: speedup_max_disk
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MAILRU_SPEEDUP_MAX_DISK
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 3G
-   Examples:
    -   “0”
        -   Completely disable speedup (put by hash).
    -   “1G”
        -   Files larger than 1Gb will be uploaded directly.
    -   “3G”
        -   Choose this option if you have less than 3Gb free on local
            disk.

–mailru-speedup-max-memory

Files larger than the size given below will always be hashed on disk.

-   Config: speedup_max_memory
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MAILRU_SPEEDUP_MAX_MEMORY
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 32M
-   Examples:
    -   “0”
        -   Preliminary hashing will always be done in a temporary disk
            location.
    -   “32M”
        -   Do not dedicate more than 32Mb RAM for preliminary hashing.
    -   “256M”
        -   You have at most 256Mb RAM free for hash calculations.

–mailru-check-hash

What should copy do if file checksum is mismatched or invalid

-   Config: check_hash
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MAILRU_CHECK_HASH
-   Type: bool
-   Default: true
-   Examples:
    -   “true”
        -   Fail with error.
    -   “false”
        -   Ignore and continue.

–mailru-user-agent

HTTP user agent used internally by client. Defaults to “rclone/VERSION”
or “–user-agent” provided on command line.

-   Config: user_agent
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MAILRU_USER_AGENT
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–mailru-quirks

Comma separated list of internal maintenance flags. This option must not
be used by an ordinary user. It is intended only to facilitate remote
troubleshooting of backend issues. Strict meaning of flags is not
documented and not guaranteed to persist between releases. Quirks will
be removed when the backend grows stable. Supported quirks: atomicmkdir
binlist gzip insecure retry400

-   Config: quirks
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MAILRU_QUIRKS
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""


Mega

Mega is a cloud storage and file hosting service known for its security
feature where all files are encrypted locally before they are uploaded.
This prevents anyone (including employees of Mega) from accessing the
files without knowledge of the key used for encryption.

This is an rclone backend for Mega which supports the file transfer
features of Mega using the same client side encryption.

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, eg remote:directory/subdirectory.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Mega
       \ "mega"
    [snip]
    Storage> mega
    User name
    user> you@example.com
    Password.
    y) Yes type in my own password
    g) Generate random password
    n) No leave this optional password blank
    y/g/n> y
    Enter the password:
    password:
    Confirm the password:
    password:
    Remote config
    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = mega
    user = you@example.com
    pass = *** ENCRYPTED ***
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

NOTE: The encryption keys need to have been already generated after a
regular login via the browser, otherwise attempting to use the
credentials in rclone will fail.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your Mega

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Mega

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Mega directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Modified time and hashes

Mega does not support modification times or hashes yet.

Restricted filename characters

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  NUL          0x00         ␀
  /            0x2F        ／

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in JSON
strings.

Duplicated files

Mega can have two files with exactly the same name and path (unlike a
normal file system).

Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.

Use rclone dedupe to fix duplicated files.

Failure to log-in

Mega remotes seem to get blocked (reject logins) under “heavy use”. We
haven’t worked out the exact blocking rules but it seems to be related
to fast paced, sucessive rclone commands.

For example, executing this command 90 times in a row
rclone link remote:file will cause the remote to become “blocked”. This
is not an abnormal situation, for example if you wish to get the public
links of a directory with hundred of files… After more or less a week,
the remote will remote accept rclone logins normally again.

You can mitigate this issue by mounting the remote it with rclone mount.
This will log-in when mounting and a log-out when unmounting only. You
can also run rclone rcd and then use rclone rc to run the commands over
the API to avoid logging in each time.

Rclone does not currently close mega sessions (you can see them in the
web interface), however closing the sessions does not solve the issue.

If you space rclone commands by 3 seconds it will avoid blocking the
remote. We haven’t identified the exact blocking rules, so perhaps one
could execute the command 80 times without waiting and avoid blocking by
waiting 3 seconds, then continuing…

Note that this has been observed by trial and error and might not be set
in stone.

Other tools seem not to produce this blocking effect, as they use a
different working approach (state-based, using sessionIDs instead of
log-in) which isn’t compatible with the current stateless rclone
approach.

Note that once blocked, the use of other tools (such as megacmd) is not
a sure workaround: following megacmd login times have been observed in
sucession for blocked remote: 7 minutes, 20 min, 30min, 30 min, 30min.
Web access looks unaffected though.

Investigation is continuing in relation to workarounds based on
timeouts, pacers, retrials and tpslimits - if you discover something
relevant, please post on the forum.

So, if rclone was working nicely and suddenly you are unable to log-in
and you are sure the user and the password are correct, likely you have
got the remote blocked for a while.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to mega (Mega).

–mega-user

User name

-   Config: user
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MEGA_USER
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–mega-pass

Password.

-   Config: pass
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MEGA_PASS
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to mega (Mega).

–mega-debug

Output more debug from Mega.

If this flag is set (along with -vv) it will print further debugging
information from the mega backend.

-   Config: debug
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MEGA_DEBUG
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–mega-hard-delete

Delete files permanently rather than putting them into the trash.

Normally the mega backend will put all deletions into the trash rather
than permanently deleting them. If you specify this then rclone will
permanently delete objects instead.

-   Config: hard_delete
-   Env Var: RCLONE_MEGA_HARD_DELETE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

Limitations

This backend uses the go-mega go library which is an opensource go
library implementing the Mega API. There doesn’t appear to be any
documentation for the mega protocol beyond the mega C++ SDK source code
so there are likely quite a few errors still remaining in this library.

Mega allows duplicate files which may confuse rclone.


Microsoft Azure Blob Storage

Paths are specified as remote:container (or remote: for the lsd
command.) You may put subdirectories in too, eg
remote:container/path/to/dir.

Here is an example of making a Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
configuration. For a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Microsoft Azure Blob Storage

    [remote]
    account = account_name
    key = base64encodedkey==
    endpoint = 
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

See all containers

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new container

    rclone mkdir remote:container

List the contents of a container

    rclone ls remote:container

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote container, deleting any excess
files in the container.

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:container

–fast-list

This remote supports --fast-list which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the rclone docs for more
details.

Modified time

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object with the mtime
key. It is stored using RFC3339 Format time with nanosecond precision.
The metadata is supplied during directory listings so there is no
overhead to using it.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  /            0x2F        ／
  \            0x5C        ＼

File names can also not end with the following characters. These only
get replaced if they are last character in the name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  .            0x2E        ．

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in JSON
strings.

Hashes

MD5 hashes are stored with blobs. However blobs that were uploaded in
chunks only have an MD5 if the source remote was capable of MD5 hashes,
eg the local disk.

Authenticating with Azure Blob Storage

Rclone has 3 ways of authenticating with Azure Blob Storage:

Account and Key

This is the most straight forward and least flexible way. Just fill in
the account and key lines and leave the rest blank.

SAS URL

This can be an account level SAS URL or container level SAS URL

To use it leave account, key blank and fill in sas_url.

Account level SAS URL or container level SAS URL can be obtained from
Azure portal or Azure Storage Explorer. To get a container level SAS URL
right click on a container in the Azure Blob explorer in the Azure
portal.

If You use container level SAS URL, rclone operations are permitted only
on particular container, eg

    rclone ls azureblob:container or rclone ls azureblob:

Since container name already exists in SAS URL, you can leave it empty
as well.

However these will not work

    rclone lsd azureblob:
    rclone ls azureblob:othercontainer

This would be useful for temporarily allowing third parties access to a
single container or putting credentials into an untrusted environment.

Multipart uploads

Rclone supports multipart uploads with Azure Blob storage. Files bigger
than 256MB will be uploaded using chunked upload by default.

The files will be uploaded in parallel in 4MB chunks (by default). Note
that these chunks are buffered in memory and there may be up to
--transfers of them being uploaded at once.

Files can’t be split into more than 50,000 chunks so by default, so the
largest file that can be uploaded with 4MB chunk size is 195GB. Above
this rclone will double the chunk size until it creates less than 50,000
chunks. By default this will mean a maximum file size of 3.2TB can be
uploaded. This can be raised to 5TB using --azureblob-chunk-size 100M.

Note that rclone doesn’t commit the block list until the end of the
upload which means that there is a limit of 9.5TB of multipart uploads
in progress as Azure won’t allow more than that amount of uncommitted
blocks.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to azureblob (Microsoft Azure
Blob Storage).

–azureblob-account

Storage Account Name (leave blank to use SAS URL or Emulator)

-   Config: account
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ACCOUNT
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–azureblob-key

Storage Account Key (leave blank to use SAS URL or Emulator)

-   Config: key
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_KEY
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–azureblob-sas-url

SAS URL for container level access only (leave blank if using
account/key or Emulator)

-   Config: sas_url
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_SAS_URL
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–azureblob-use-emulator

Uses local storage emulator if provided as ‘true’ (leave blank if using
real azure storage endpoint)

-   Config: use_emulator
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_USE_EMULATOR
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to azureblob (Microsoft Azure
Blob Storage).

–azureblob-endpoint

Endpoint for the service Leave blank normally.

-   Config: endpoint
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ENDPOINT
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–azureblob-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload (<= 256MB).

-   Config: upload_cutoff
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 256M

–azureblob-chunk-size

Upload chunk size (<= 100MB).

Note that this is stored in memory and there may be up to “–transfers”
chunks stored at once in memory.

-   Config: chunk_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_CHUNK_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 4M

–azureblob-list-chunk

Size of blob list.

This sets the number of blobs requested in each listing chunk. Default
is the maximum, 5000. “List blobs” requests are permitted 2 minutes per
megabyte to complete. If an operation is taking longer than 2 minutes
per megabyte on average, it will time out ( source ). This can be used
to limit the number of blobs items to return, to avoid the time out.

-   Config: list_chunk
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_LIST_CHUNK
-   Type: int
-   Default: 5000

–azureblob-access-tier

Access tier of blob: hot, cool or archive.

Archived blobs can be restored by setting access tier to hot or cool.
Leave blank if you intend to use default access tier, which is set at
account level

If there is no “access tier” specified, rclone doesn’t apply any tier.
rclone performs “Set Tier” operation on blobs while uploading, if
objects are not modified, specifying “access tier” to new one will have
no effect. If blobs are in “archive tier” at remote, trying to perform
data transfer operations from remote will not be allowed. User should
first restore by tiering blob to “Hot” or “Cool”.

-   Config: access_tier
-   Env Var: RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ACCESS_TIER
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

Limitations

MD5 sums are only uploaded with chunked files if the source has an MD5
sum. This will always be the case for a local to azure copy.

Azure Storage Emulator Support

You can test rlcone with storage emulator locally, to do this make sure
azure storage emulator installed locally and set up a new remote with
rclone config follow instructions described in introduction, set
use_emulator config as true, you do not need to provide default account
name or key if using emulator.


Microsoft OneDrive

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, eg remote:directory/subdirectory.

The initial setup for OneDrive involves getting a token from Microsoft
which you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks you through
it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    e) Edit existing remote
    n) New remote
    d) Delete remote
    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password

See the remote setup docs for how to set it up on a machine with no
Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Microsoft. This only runs from the moment it
opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.
This is on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it may require you to
unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your OneDrive

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your OneDrive

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an OneDrive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Getting your own Client ID and Key

rclone uses a pair of Client ID and Key shared by all rclone users when
performing requests by default. If you are having problems with them
(E.g., seeing a lot of throttling), you can get your own Client ID and
Key by following the steps below:

1.  Open
    https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade,
    then click New registration.
2.  Enter a name for your app, choose your account type, select Web in
    Redirect URI Enter http://localhost:53682/ and click Register. Copy
    and keep the Application (client) ID under the app name for later
    use.
3.  Under manage select Certificates & secrets, click New client secret.
    Copy and keep that secret for later use.
4.  Under manage select API permissions, click Add a permission and
    select Microsoft Graph then select delegated permissions.
5.  Search and select the follwing permssions: Files.Read,
    Files.ReadWrite, Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All,
    offline_access, User.Read. Once selected click Add permissions at
    the bottom.

Now the application is complete. Run rclone config to create or edit a
OneDrive remote. Supply the app ID and password as Client ID and Secret,
respectively. rclone will walk you through the remaining steps.

Modification time and hashes

OneDrive allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

OneDrive personal supports SHA1 type hashes. OneDrive for business and
Sharepoint Server support QuickXorHash.

For all types of OneDrive you can use the --checksum flag.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  "            0x22        ＂
  *            0x2A        ＊
  :            0x3A        ：
  <            0x3C        ＜
  >            0x3E        ＞
  ?            0x3F        ？
  \            0x5C        ＼
  |            0x7C        ｜
  #            0x23        ＃
  %            0x25        ％

File names can also not end with the following characters. These only
get replaced if they are last character in the name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  SP           0x20         ␠
  .            0x2E        ．

File names can also not begin with the following characters. These only
get replaced if they are first character in the name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  SP           0x20         ␠
  ~            0x7E        ～

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in JSON
strings.

Deleting files

Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash. Microsoft
doesn’t provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to empty the
trash, so you will have to do that with one of Microsoft’s apps or via
the OneDrive website.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to onedrive (Microsoft OneDrive).

–onedrive-client-id

Microsoft App Client Id Leave blank normally.

-   Config: client_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_CLIENT_ID
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–onedrive-client-secret

Microsoft App Client Secret Leave blank normally.

-   Config: client_secret
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to onedrive (Microsoft OneDrive).

–onedrive-chunk-size

Chunk size to upload files with - must be multiple of 320k (327,680
bytes).

Above this size files will be chunked - must be multiple of 320k
(327,680 bytes). Note that the chunks will be buffered into memory.

-   Config: chunk_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_CHUNK_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 10M

–onedrive-drive-id

The ID of the drive to use

-   Config: drive_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_DRIVE_ID
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–onedrive-drive-type

The type of the drive ( personal | business | documentLibrary )

-   Config: drive_type
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_DRIVE_TYPE
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–onedrive-expose-onenote-files

Set to make OneNote files show up in directory listings.

By default rclone will hide OneNote files in directory listings because
operations like “Open” and “Update” won’t work on them. But this
behaviour may also prevent you from deleting them. If you want to delete
OneNote files or otherwise want them to show up in directory listing,
set this option.

-   Config: expose_onenote_files
-   Env Var: RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_EXPOSE_ONENOTE_FILES
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

Limitations

Naming

Note that OneDrive is case insensitive so you can’t have a file called
“Hello.doc” and one called “hello.doc”.

There are quite a few characters that can’t be in OneDrive file names.
These can’t occur on Windows platforms, but on non-Windows platforms
they are common. Rclone will map these names to and from an identical
looking unicode equivalent. For example if a file has a ? in it will be
mapped to ？ instead.

File sizes

The largest allowed file sizes are 15GB for OneDrive for Business and
35GB for OneDrive Personal (Updated 4 Jan 2019).

Path length

The entire path, including the file name, must contain fewer than 400
characters for OneDrive, OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online. If
you are encrypting file and folder names with rclone, you may want to
pay attention to this limitation because the encrypted names are
typically longer than the original ones.

Number of files

OneDrive seems to be OK with at least 50,000 files in a folder, but at
100,000 rclone will get errors listing the directory like
couldn’t list files: UnknownError:. See #2707 for more info.

An official document about the limitations for different types of
OneDrive can be found here.

Versioning issue

Every change in OneDrive causes the service to create a new version.
This counts against a users quota. For example changing the modification
time of a file creates a second version, so the file is using twice the
space.

The copy is the only rclone command affected by this as we copy the file
and then afterwards set the modification time to match the source file.

NOTE: Starting October 2018, users will no longer be able to disable
versioning by default. This is because Microsoft has brought an update
to the mechanism. To change this new default setting, a PowerShell
command is required to be run by a SharePoint admin. If you are an
admin, you can run these commands in PowerShell to change that setting:

1.  Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell (in case
    you haven’t installed this already)
2.  Import-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -DisableNameChecking
3.  Connect-SPOService -Url https://YOURSITE-admin.sharepoint.com -Credential YOU@YOURSITE.COM
    (replacing YOURSITE, YOU, YOURSITE.COM with the actual values; this
    will prompt for your credentials)
4.  Set-SPOTenant -EnableMinimumVersionRequirement $False
5.  Disconnect-SPOService (to disconnect from the server)

_Below are the steps for normal users to disable versioning. If you
don’t see the “No Versioning” option, make sure the above requirements
are met._

User Weropol has found a method to disable versioning on OneDrive

1.  Open the settings menu by clicking on the gear symbol at the top of
    the OneDrive Business page.
2.  Click Site settings.
3.  Once on the Site settings page, navigate to Site Administration >
    Site libraries and lists.
4.  Click Customize “Documents”.
5.  Click General Settings > Versioning Settings.
6.  Under Document Version History select the option No versioning.
    Note: This will disable the creation of new file versions, but will
    not remove any previous versions. Your documents are safe.
7.  Apply the changes by clicking OK.
8.  Use rclone to upload or modify files. (I also use the
    –no-update-modtime flag)
9.  Restore the versioning settings after using rclone. (Optional)

Troubleshooting

Unexpected file size/hash differences on Sharepoint

It is a known issue that Sharepoint (not OneDrive or OneDrive for
Business) silently modifies uploaded files, mainly Office files (.docx,
.xlsx, etc.), causing file size and hash checks to fail. To use rclone
with such affected files on Sharepoint, you may disable these checks
with the following command line arguments:

    --ignore-checksum --ignore-size

Replacing/deleting existing files on Sharepoint gets “item not found”

It is a known issue that Sharepoint (not OneDrive or OneDrive for
Business) may return “item not found” errors when users try to replace
or delete uploaded files; this seems to mainly affect Office files
(.docx, .xlsx, etc.). As a workaround, you may use the
--backup-dir <BACKUP_DIR> command line argument so rclone moves the
files to be replaced/deleted into a given backup directory (instead of
directly replacing/deleting them). For example, to instruct rclone to
move the files into the directory rclone-backup-dir on backend
mysharepoint, you may use:

    --backup-dir mysharepoint:rclone-backup-dir

access_denied (AADSTS65005)

    Error: access_denied
    Code: AADSTS65005
    Description: Using application 'rclone' is currently not supported for your organization [YOUR_ORGANIZATION] because it is in an unmanaged state. An administrator needs to claim ownership of the company by DNS validation of [YOUR_ORGANIZATION] before the application rclone can be provisioned.

This means that rclone can’t use the OneDrive for Business API with your
account. You can’t do much about it, maybe write an email to your
admins.

However, there are other ways to interact with your OneDrive account.
Have a look at the webdav backend: https://rclone.org/webdav/#sharepoint

invalid_grant (AADSTS50076)

    Error: invalid_grant
    Code: AADSTS50076
    Description: Due to a configuration change made by your administrator, or because you moved to a new location, you must use multi-factor authentication to access '...'.

If you see the error above after enabling multi-factor authentication
for your account, you can fix it by refreshing your OAuth refresh token.
To do that, run rclone config, and choose to edit your OneDrive backend.
Then, you don’t need to actually make any changes until you reach this
question: Already have a token - refresh?. For this question, answer y
and go through the process to refresh your token, just like the first
time the backend is configured. After this, rclone should work again for
this backend.

File names can also not begin or end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the first or last character in the
name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  SP           0x20         ␠

See all buckets

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote bucket, deleting any excess
files in the bucket.

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:bucket

–fast-list

This remote supports --fast-list which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the rclone docs for more
details.

Multipart uploads

rclone supports multipart uploads with QingStor which means that it can
upload files bigger than 5GB. Note that files uploaded with multipart
upload don’t have an MD5SUM.

Buckets and Zone

With QingStor you can list buckets (rclone lsd) using any zone, but you
can only access the content of a bucket from the zone it was created in.
If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong zone, you will get an
error, incorrect zone, the bucket is not in 'XXX' zone.

Authentication

There are two ways to supply rclone with a set of QingStor credentials.
In order of precedence:

-   Directly in the rclone configuration file (as configured by
    rclone config)
    -   set access_key_id and secret_access_key
-   Runtime configuration:
    -   set env_auth to true in the config file
    -   Exporting the following environment variables before running
        rclone
        -   Access Key ID: QS_ACCESS_KEY_ID or QS_ACCESS_KEY
        -   Secret Access Key: QS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY or QS_SECRET_KEY

Restricted filename characters

The control characters 0x00-0x1F and / are replaced as in the default
restricted characters set. Note that 0x7F is not replaced.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in JSON
strings.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to qingstor (QingCloud Object
Storage).

–qingstor-env-auth

Get QingStor credentials from runtime. Only applies if access_key_id and
secret_access_key is blank.

-   Config: env_auth
-   Env Var: RCLONE_QINGSTOR_ENV_AUTH
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false
-   Examples:
    -   “false”
        -   Enter QingStor credentials in the next step
    -   “true”
        -   Get QingStor credentials from the environment (env vars or
            IAM)

–qingstor-access-key-id

QingStor Access Key ID Leave blank for anonymous access or runtime
credentials.

-   Config: access_key_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_QINGSTOR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–qingstor-secret-access-key

QingStor Secret Access Key (password) Leave blank for anonymous access
or runtime credentials.

-   Config: secret_access_key
-   Env Var: RCLONE_QINGSTOR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–qingstor-endpoint

Enter a endpoint URL to connection QingStor API. Leave blank will use
the default value “https://qingstor.com:443”

-   Config: endpoint
-   Env Var: RCLONE_QINGSTOR_ENDPOINT
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–qingstor-zone

Zone to connect to. Default is “pek3a”.

-   Config: zone
-   Env Var: RCLONE_QINGSTOR_ZONE
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""
-   Examples:
    -   “pek3a”
        -   The Beijing (China) Three Zone
        -   Needs location constraint pek3a.
    -   “sh1a”
        -   The Shanghai (China) First Zone
        -   Needs location constraint sh1a.
    -   “gd2a”
        -   The Guangdong (China) Second Zone
        -   Needs location constraint gd2a.

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to qingstor (QingCloud Object
Storage).

–qingstor-connection-retries

Number of connection retries.

-   Config: connection_retries
-   Env Var: RCLONE_QINGSTOR_CONNECTION_RETRIES
-   Type: int
-   Default: 3

–qingstor-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload

Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of chunk_size. The
minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5GB.

-   Config: upload_cutoff
-   Env Var: RCLONE_QINGSTOR_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 200M

–qingstor-chunk-size

Chunk size to use for uploading.

When uploading files larger than upload_cutoff they will be uploaded as
multipart uploads using this chunk size.

Note that “–qingstor-upload-concurrency” chunks of this size are
buffered in memory per transfer.

If you are transferring large files over high speed links and you have
enough memory, then increasing this will speed up the transfers.

-   Config: chunk_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_QINGSTOR_CHUNK_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 4M

–qingstor-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for multipart uploads.

This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded
concurrently.

NB if you set this to > 1 then the checksums of multpart uploads become
corrupted (the uploads themselves are not corrupted though).

If you are uploading small numbers of large file over high speed link
and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing
this may help to speed up the transfers.

-   Config: upload_concurrency
-   Env Var: RCLONE_QINGSTOR_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
-   Type: int
-   Default: 1


Swift

Swift refers to Openstack Object Storage. Commercial implementations of
that being:

-   Rackspace Cloud Files
-   Memset Memstore
-   OVH Object Storage
-   Oracle Cloud Storage
-   IBM Bluemix Cloud ObjectStorage Swift

Paths are specified as remote:container (or remote: for the lsd
command.) You may put subdirectories in too, eg
remote:container/path/to/dir.

Here is an example of making a swift configuration. First run

This remote is called remote and can now be used like this

See all containers

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new container

    rclone mkdir remote:container

List the contents of a container

    rclone ls remote:container

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote container, deleting any excess
files in the container.

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:container

Configuration from an OpenStack credentials file

An OpenStack credentials file typically looks something something like
this (without the comments)

    export OS_AUTH_URL=https://a.provider.net/v2.0
    export OS_TENANT_ID=ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
    export OS_TENANT_NAME="1234567890123456"
    export OS_USERNAME="123abc567xy"
    echo "Please enter your OpenStack Password: "
    read -sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
    export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
    export OS_REGION_NAME="SBG1"
    if [ -z "$OS_REGION_NAME" ]; then unset OS_REGION_NAME; fi

The config file needs to look something like this where $OS_USERNAME
represents the value of the OS_USERNAME variable - 123abc567xy in the
example above.

    [remote]
    type = swift
    user = $OS_USERNAME
    key = $OS_PASSWORD
    auth = $OS_AUTH_URL
    tenant = $OS_TENANT_NAME

Note that you may (or may not) need to set region too - try without
first.

Configuration from the environment

If you prefer you can configure rclone to use swift using a standard set
of OpenStack environment variables.

When you run through the config, make sure you choose true for env_auth
and leave everything else blank.

rclone will then set any empty config parameters from the environment
using standard OpenStack environment variables. There is a list of the
variables in the docs for the swift library.

Using an alternate authentication method

If your OpenStack installation uses a non-standard authentication method
that might not be yet supported by rclone or the underlying swift
library, you can authenticate externally (e.g. calling manually the
openstack commands to get a token). Then, you just need to pass the two
configuration variables auth_token and storage_url. If they are both
provided, the other variables are ignored. rclone will not try to
authenticate but instead assume it is already authenticated and use
these two variables to access the OpenStack installation.

Using rclone without a config file

You can use rclone with swift without a config file, if desired, like
this:

    source openstack-credentials-file
    export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_TYPE=swift
    export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_ENV_AUTH=true
    rclone lsd myremote:

–fast-list

This remote supports --fast-list which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the rclone docs for more
details.

–update and –use-server-modtime

As noted below, the modified time is stored on metadata on the object.
It is used by default for all operations that require checking the time
a file was last updated. It allows rclone to treat the remote more like
a true filesystem, but it is inefficient because it requires an extra
API call to retrieve the metadata.

For many operations, the time the object was last uploaded to the remote
is sufficient to determine if it is “dirty”. By using --update along
with --use-server-modtime, you can avoid the extra API call and simply
upload files whose local modtime is newer than the time it was last
uploaded.

    -   “pcs”
        -   OVH Public Cloud Storage
    -   “pca”
        -   OVH Public Cloud Archive

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to swift (Openstack Swift
(Rackspace Cloud Files, Memset Memstore, OVH)).

–swift-chunk-size

Above this size files will be chunked into a _segments container.

Above this size files will be chunked into a _segments container. The
default for this is 5GB which is its maximum value.

-   Config: chunk_size
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SWIFT_CHUNK_SIZE
-   Type: SizeSuffix
-   Default: 5G

–swift-no-chunk

Don’t chunk files during streaming upload.

When doing streaming uploads (eg using rcat or mount) setting this flag
will cause the swift backend to not upload chunked files.

This will limit the maximum upload size to 5GB. However non chunked
files are easier to deal with and have an MD5SUM.

Rclone will still chunk files bigger than chunk_size when doing normal
copy operations.

-   Config: no_chunk
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SWIFT_NO_CHUNK
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

Modified time

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
X-Object-Meta-Mtime as floating point since the epoch accurate to 1 ns.

This is a defacto standard (used in the official python-swiftclient
amongst others) for storing the modification time for an object.

Restricted filename characters

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  NUL          0x00         ␀
  /            0x2F        ／

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in JSON
strings.

Limitations

The Swift API doesn’t return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files
(Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won’t check or use the
MD5SUM for these.

Troubleshooting

Rclone gives Failed to create file system for “remote:”: Bad Request

Due to an oddity of the underlying swift library, it gives a “Bad
Request” error rather than a more sensible error when the authentication
fails for Swift.

So this most likely means your username / password is wrong. You can
investigate further with the --dump-bodies flag.

This may also be caused by specifying the region when you shouldn’t have
(eg OVH).

Rclone gives Failed to create file system: Response didn’t have storage storage url and auth token

This is most likely caused by forgetting to specify your tenant when
setting up a swift remote.


pCloud

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, eg remote:directory/subdirectory.

The initial setup for pCloud involves getting a token from pCloud which
you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Pcloud
       \ "pcloud"
    [snip]
    Storage> pcloud
    Pcloud App Client Id - leave blank normally.
    client_id> 
    Pcloud App Client Secret - leave blank normally.
    client_secret> 
    Remote config
    Use auto config?
     * Say Y if not sure
     * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> y
    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    --------------------
    [remote]
    client_id = 
    client_secret = 
    token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"bearer","expiry":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

See the remote setup docs for how to set it up on a machine with no
Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from pCloud. This only runs from the moment it opens
your browser to the moment you get back the verification code. This is
on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it may require you to unblock it
temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your pCloud

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your pCloud

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an pCloud directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Modified time and hashes

pCloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not. In order to set a Modification time pCloud requires the object be
re-uploaded.

pCloud supports MD5 and SHA1 type hashes, so you can use the --checksum
flag.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  \            0x5C        ＼

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in JSON
strings.

Deleting files

Deleted files will be moved to the trash. Your subscription level will
determine how long items stay in the trash. rclone cleanup can be used
to empty the trash.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to pcloud (Pcloud).

–pcloud-client-id

Pcloud App Client Id Leave blank normally.

-   Config: client_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_PCLOUD_CLIENT_ID

–pcloud-client-secret

Pcloud App Client Secret Leave blank normally.

-   Config: client_secret
-   Env Var: RCLONE_PCLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""


premiumize.me

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, eg remote:directory/subdirectory.

The initial setup for premiumize.me involves getting a token from
premiumize.me which you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks
you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = premiumizeme
    token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"Bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"2029-08-07T18:44:15.548915378+01:00"}

    y/e/d> 

See the remote setup docs for how to set it up on a machine with no
Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from premiumize.me. This only runs from the moment it
opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.
This is on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it may require you to
unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your premiumize.me

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your premiumize.me

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an premiumize.me directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Modified time and hashes

premiumize.me does not support modification times or hashes, therefore
syncing will default to --size-only checking. Note that using --update
will work.

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  \            0x5C        ＼
  "            0x22        ＂

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in JSON
strings.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to premiumizeme (premiumize.me).

–premiumizeme-api-key

API Key.

This is not normally used - use oauth instead.

-   Config: api_key
-   Env Var: RCLONE_PREMIUMIZEME_API_KEY
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

Limitations

Note that premiumize.me is case insensitive so you can’t have a file
called “Hello.doc” and one called “hello.doc”.

premiumize.me file names can’t have the \ or " characters in. rclone
maps these to and from an identical looking unicode equivalents ＼ and
＂

premiumize.me only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.


put.io

Paths are specified as remote:path

put.io paths may be as deep as required, eg
remote:directory/subdirectory.

The initial setup for put.io involves getting a token from put.io which
you need to do in your browser. rclone config walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> putio
    Type of storage to configure.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Put.io
       \ "putio"
    [snip]
    Storage> putio
    ** See help for putio backend at: https://rclone.org/putio/ **

    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    --------------------
    [putio]
    type = putio
    token = {"access_token":"XXXXXXXX","expiry":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote

    e) Edit existing remote
    n) New remote
    d) Delete remote
    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode. This only
runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code. This is on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it
may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host
firewall, or use manual mode.

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your put.io

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your put.io

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a put.io directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Restricted filename characters

In addition to the default restricted characters set the following
characters are also replaced:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  \            0x5C        ＼

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in JSON
strings.


SFTP

SFTP is the Secure (or SSH) File Transfer Protocol.

The SFTP backend can be used with a number of different providers:

-   C14
-   rsync.net

SFTP runs over SSH v2 and is installed as standard with most modern SSH
installations.

Paths are specified as remote:path. If the path does not begin with a /
it is relative to the home directory of the user. An empty path remote:
refers to the user’s home directory.

"Note that some SFTP servers will need the leading / - Synology is a
good example of this. rsync.net, on the other hand, requires users to
OMIT the leading /.

Here is an example of making an SFTP configuration. First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n

    user = sftpuser
    port =
    pass =
    key_file =
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

This remote is called remote and can now be used like this:

See all directories in the home directory

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:path/to/directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:path/to/directory

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote directory, deleting any excess
files in the directory.

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:directory

SSH Authentication

The SFTP remote supports three authentication methods:

-   Password
-   Key file
-   ssh-agent

Key files should be PEM-encoded private key files. For instance
/home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa. Only unencrypted OpenSSH or PEM encrypted files
are supported.

If you don’t specify pass or key_file then rclone will attempt to
contact an ssh-agent.

You can also specify key_use_agent to force the usage of an ssh-agent.
In this case key_file can also be specified to force the usage of a
specific key in the ssh-agent.

Using an ssh-agent is the only way to load encrypted OpenSSH keys at the
moment.

If you set the --sftp-ask-password option, rclone will prompt for a
password when needed and no password has been configured.

ssh-agent on macOS

Note that there seem to be various problems with using an ssh-agent on
macOS due to recent changes in the OS. The most effective work-around
seems to be to start an ssh-agent in each session, eg

    eval `ssh-agent -s` && ssh-add -A

And then at the end of the session

    eval `ssh-agent -k`

These commands can be used in scripts of course.

Modified time

Modified times are stored on the server to 1 second precision.

Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported.

Some SFTP servers disable setting/modifying the file modification time
after upload (for example, certain configurations of ProFTPd with
mod_sftp). If you are using one of these servers, you can set the option
set_modtime = false in your RClone backend configuration to disable this
behaviour.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to sftp (SSH/SFTP Connection).

–sftp-host

SSH host to connect to

-   Config: host
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_HOST
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""
-   Examples:
    -   “example.com”
        -   Connect to example.com

–sftp-user

SSH username, leave blank for current username, ncw

-   Config: user
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_USER
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–sftp-port

SSH port, leave blank to use default (22)

-   Config: port
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_PORT
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–sftp-pass

SSH password, leave blank to use ssh-agent.

-   Config: pass
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_PASS
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–sftp-key-file

Path to PEM-encoded private key file, leave blank or set key-use-agent
to use ssh-agent.

-   Config: key_file
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_KEY_FILE
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–sftp-key-file-pass

The passphrase to decrypt the PEM-encoded private key file.

Only PEM encrypted key files (old OpenSSH format) are supported.
Encrypted keys in the new OpenSSH format can’t be used.

-   Config: key_file_pass
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_KEY_FILE_PASS
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–sftp-key-use-agent

When set forces the usage of the ssh-agent.

When key-file is also set, the “.pub” file of the specified key-file is
read and only the associated key is requested from the ssh-agent. This
allows to avoid Too many authentication failures for *username* errors
when the ssh-agent contains many keys.

-   Config: key_use_agent
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_KEY_USE_AGENT
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–sftp-use-insecure-cipher

Enable the use of insecure ciphers and key exchange methods.

This enables the use of the the following insecure ciphers and key
exchange methods:

-   aes128-cbc
-   aes192-cbc
-   aes256-cbc
-   3des-cbc
-   diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256
-   diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1

Those algorithms are insecure and may allow plaintext data to be
recovered by an attacker.

-   Config: use_insecure_cipher
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_USE_INSECURE_CIPHER
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false
-   Examples:
    -   “false”
        -   Use default Cipher list.
    -   “true”
        -   Enables the use of the aes128-cbc cipher and
            diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,
            diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1 key exchange.

–sftp-disable-hashcheck

Disable the execution of SSH commands to determine if remote file
hashing is available. Leave blank or set to false to enable hashing
(recommended), set to true to disable hashing.

-   Config: disable_hashcheck
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_DISABLE_HASHCHECK
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to sftp (SSH/SFTP Connection).

–sftp-ask-password

Allow asking for SFTP password when needed.

If this is set and no password is supplied then rclone will: - ask for a
password - not contact the ssh agent

-   Config: ask_password
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_ASK_PASSWORD
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–sftp-path-override

Override path used by SSH connection.

This allows checksum calculation when SFTP and SSH paths are different.
This issue affects among others Synology NAS boxes.

Shared folders can be found in directories representing volumes

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/directory --ssh-path-override /volume2/directory

Home directory can be found in a shared folder called “home”

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/home/directory --ssh-path-override /volume1/homes/USER/directory

-   Config: path_override
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_PATH_OVERRIDE
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–sftp-set-modtime

Set the modified time on the remote if set.

-   Config: set_modtime
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_SET_MODTIME
-   Type: bool
-   Default: true

–sftp-md5sum-command

The command used to read md5 hashes. Leave blank for autodetect.

-   Config: md5sum_command
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_MD5SUM_COMMAND
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–sftp-sha1sum-command

The command used to read sha1 hashes. Leave blank for autodetect.

-   Config: sha1sum_command
-   Env Var: RCLONE_SFTP_SHA1SUM_COMMAND
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

Limitations

SFTP supports checksums if the same login has shell access and md5sum or
sha1sum as well as echo are in the remote’s PATH. This remote
checksumming (file hashing) is recommended and enabled by default.
Disabling the checksumming may be required if you are connecting to SFTP
servers which are not under your control, and to which the execution of
remote commands is prohibited. Set the configuration option
disable_hashcheck to true to disable checksumming.

SFTP also supports about if the same login has shell access and df are
in the remote’s PATH. about will return the total space, free space, and
used space on the remote for the disk of the specified path on the
remote or, if not set, the disk of the root on the remote. about will
fail if it does not have shell access or if df is not in the remote’s
PATH.

Note that some SFTP servers (eg Synology) the paths are different for
SSH and SFTP so the hashes can’t be calculated properly. For them using
disable_hashcheck is a good idea.

The only ssh agent supported under Windows is Putty’s pageant.

The Go SSH library disables the use of the aes128-cbc cipher by default,
due to security concerns. This can be re-enabled on a per-connection
basis by setting the use_insecure_cipher setting in the configuration
file to true. Further details on the insecurity of this cipher can be
found [in this paper] (http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~kp/SandPfinal.pdf).

SFTP isn’t supported under plan9 until this issue is fixed.

Note that since SFTP isn’t HTTP based the following flags don’t work
with it: --dump-headers, --dump-bodies, --dump-auth

Note that --timeout isn’t supported (but --contimeout is).


C14

C14 is supported through the SFTP backend.

See C14’s documentation


rsync.net

rsync.net is supported through the SFTP backend.

See rsync.net’s documentation of rclone examples.


Union

The union remote provides a unification similar to UnionFS using other
remotes.

Paths may be as deep as required or a local path, eg
remote:directory/subdirectory or /directory/subdirectory.

During the initial setup with rclone config you will specify the target
remotes as a space separated list. The target remotes can either be a
local paths or other remotes.

The order of the remotes is important as it defines which remotes take
precedence over others if there are files with the same name in the same
logical path. The last remote is the topmost remote and replaces files
with the same name from previous remotes.

Only the last remote is used to write to and delete from, all other
remotes are read-only.

Subfolders can be used in target remote. Assume a union remote named
backup with the remotes mydrive:private/backup mydrive2:/backup.
Invoking rclone mkdir backup:desktop is exactly the same as invoking
rclone mkdir mydrive2:/backup/desktop.

There will be no special handling of paths containing .. segments.
Invoking rclone mkdir backup:../desktop is exactly the same as invoking
rclone mkdir mydrive2:/backup/../desktop.

Here is an example of how to make a union called remote for local
folders. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Union merges the contents of several remotes
       \ "union"
    [snip]
    Storage> union
    List of space separated remotes.
    Can be 'remotea:test/dir remoteb:', '"remotea:test/space dir" remoteb:', etc.
    The last remote is used to write to.
    Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
    remotes>
    Remote config
    --------------------
    [remote]
    type = union
    remotes = C:\dir1 C:\dir2 C:\dir3
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote

    remote               union

    e) Edit existing remote
    n) New remote
    d) Delete remote
    r) Rename remote
    c) Copy remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level in C:\dir1, C:\dir2 and C:\dir3

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in C:\dir1, C:\dir2 and C:\dir3

    rclone ls remote:

Copy another local directory to the union directory called source, which
will be placed into C:\dir3

    rclone copy C:\source remote:source

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to union (Union merges the
contents of several remotes).

–union-remotes

List of space separated remotes. Can be ‘remotea:test/dir remoteb:’,
‘“remotea:test/space dir” remoteb:’, etc. The last remote is used to
write to.

-   Config: remotes
-   Env Var: RCLONE_UNION_REMOTES
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""


WebDAV

Paths are specified as remote:path

Paths may be as deep as required, eg remote:directory/subdirectory.

To configure the WebDAV remote you will need to have a URL for it, and a
username and password. If you know what kind of system you are
connecting to then rclone can enable extra features.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called remote. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    q) Quit config
    n/s/q> n

    type = webdav
    url = https://example.com/remote.php/webdav/
    vendor = nextcloud
    user = user
    pass = *** ENCRYPTED ***
    bearer_token =
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

List directories in top level of your WebDAV

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your WebDAV

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an WebDAV directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Modified time and hashes

Plain WebDAV does not support modified times. However when used with
Owncloud or Nextcloud rclone will support modified times.

Likewise plain WebDAV does not support hashes, however when used with
Owncloud or Nextcloud rclone will support SHA1 and MD5 hashes. Depending
on the exact version of Owncloud or Nextcloud hashes may appear on all
objects, or only on objects which had a hash uploaded with them.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to webdav (Webdav).

–webdav-url

URL of http host to connect to

-   Config: url
-   Env Var: RCLONE_WEBDAV_URL
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""
-   Examples:
    -   “https://example.com”
        -   Connect to example.com

–webdav-vendor

Name of the Webdav site/service/software you are using

-   Config: vendor
-   Env Var: RCLONE_WEBDAV_VENDOR
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""
-   Examples:
    -   “nextcloud”
        -   Nextcloud
    -   “owncloud”
        -   Owncloud
    -   “sharepoint”
        -   Sharepoint
    -   “other”
        -   Other site/service or software

–webdav-user

User name

-   Config: user
-   Env Var: RCLONE_WEBDAV_USER
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–webdav-pass

Password.

-   Config: pass
-   Env Var: RCLONE_WEBDAV_PASS
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–webdav-bearer-token

Bearer token instead of user/pass (eg a Macaroon)

-   Config: bearer_token
-   Env Var: RCLONE_WEBDAV_BEARER_TOKEN
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to webdav (Webdav).

–webdav-bearer-token-command

Command to run to get a bearer token

-   Config: bearer_token_command
-   Env Var: RCLONE_WEBDAV_BEARER_TOKEN_COMMAND
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""


Provider notes

See below for notes on specific providers.

Owncloud

Click on the settings cog in the bottom right of the page and this will
show the WebDAV URL that rclone needs in the config step. It will look
something like https://example.com/remote.php/webdav/.

Owncloud supports modified times using the X-OC-Mtime header.

Nextcloud

This is configured in an identical way to Owncloud. Note that Nextcloud
does not support streaming of files (rcat) whereas Owncloud does. This
may be fixed in the future.

Sharepoint

Rclone can be used with Sharepoint provided by OneDrive for Business or
Office365 Education Accounts. This feature is only needed for a few of
these Accounts, mostly Office365 Education ones. These accounts are
sometimes not verified by the domain owner github#1975

This means that these accounts can’t be added using the official API
(other Accounts should work with the “onedrive” option). However, it is
possible to access them using webdav.

To use a sharepoint remote with rclone, add it like this: First, you
need to get your remote’s URL:

-   Go here to open your OneDrive or to sign in
-   Now take a look at your address bar, the URL should look like this:
    https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR-EMAIL]/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx

You’ll only need this URL upto the email address. After that, you’ll
most likely want to add “/Documents”. That subdirectory contains the
actual data stored on your OneDrive.

Add the remote to rclone like this: Configure the url as
https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR-EMAIL]/Documents
and use your normal account email and password for user and pass. If you
have 2FA enabled, you have to generate an app password. Set the vendor
to sharepoint.

Your config file should look like this:

    [sharepoint]
    type = webdav
    url = https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR-EMAIL]/Documents
    vendor = other
    user = YourEmailAddress
    pass = encryptedpassword

Required Flags for SharePoint

As SharePoint does some special things with uploaded documents, you
won’t be able to use the documents size or the documents hash to compare
if a file has been changed since the upload / which file is newer.

For Rclone calls copying files (especially Office files such as .docx,
.xlsx, etc.) from/to SharePoint (like copy, sync, etc.), you should
append these flags to ensure Rclone uses the “Last Modified” datetime
property to compare your documents:

    --ignore-size --ignore-checksum --update

dCache

dCache is a storage system that supports many protocols and
authentication/authorisation schemes. For WebDAV clients, it allows
users to authenticate with username and password (BASIC), X.509,
Kerberos, and various bearer tokens, including Macaroons and
OpenID-Connect access tokens.

Configure as normal using the other type. Don’t enter a username or
password, instead enter your Macaroon as the bearer_token.

The config will end up looking something like this.

    [dcache]
    type = webdav
    url = https://dcache...
    vendor = other
    user =
    pass =
    bearer_token = your-macaroon

There is a script that obtains a Macaroon from a dCache WebDAV endpoint,
and creates an rclone config file.

Macaroons may also be obtained from the dCacheView
web-browser/JavaScript client that comes with dCache.

OpenID-Connect

dCache also supports authenticating with OpenID-Connect access tokens.
OpenID-Connect is a protocol (based on OAuth 2.0) that allows services
to identify users who have authenticated with some central service.

Support for OpenID-Connect in rclone is currently achieved using another
software package called oidc-agent. This is a command-line tool that
facilitates obtaining an access token. Once installed and configured, an
access token is obtained by running the oidc-token command. The
following example shows a (shortened) access token obtained from the
_XDC_ OIDC Provider.

    paul@celebrimbor:~$ oidc-token XDC
    eyJraWQ[...]QFXDt0
    paul@celebrimbor:~$

NOTE Before the oidc-token command will work, the refresh token must be
loaded into the oidc agent. This is done with the oidc-add command
(e.g., oidc-add XDC). This is typically done once per login session.
Full details on this and how to register oidc-agent with your OIDC
Provider are provided in the oidc-agent documentation.

The rclone bearer_token_command configuration option is used to fetch
the access token from oidc-agent.

Configure as a normal WebDAV endpoint, using the ‘other’ vendor, leaving
the username and password empty. When prompted, choose to edit the
advanced config and enter the command to get a bearer token (e.g.,
oidc-agent XDC).

The following example config shows a WebDAV endpoint that uses
oidc-agent to supply an access token from the _XDC_ OIDC Provider.

    [dcache]
    type = webdav
    url = https://dcache.example.org/
    vendor = other
    bearer_token_command = oidc-token XDC


Yandex Disk

Yandex Disk is a cloud storage solution created by Yandex.

Here is an example of making a yandex configuration. First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

    No remotes found - make a new one
    n) New remote
    s) Set configuration password
    n/s> n
    name> remote
    Type of storage to configure.
    Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
    [snip]
    XX / Yandex Disk
       \ "yandex"
    [snip]
    Storage> yandex
    Yandex Client Id - leave blank normally.
    client_id>
    Yandex Client Secret - leave blank normally.
    client_secret>
    Remote config
    Use auto config?
     * Say Y if not sure
     * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
    y) Yes
    n) No
    y/n> y
    If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
    Log in and authorize rclone for access
    Waiting for code...
    Got code
    --------------------
    [remote]
    client_id =
    client_secret =
    token = {"access_token":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","token_type":"bearer","expiry":"2016-12-29T12:27:11.362788025Z"}
    --------------------
    y) Yes this is OK
    e) Edit this remote
    d) Delete this remote
    y/e/d> y

See the remote setup docs for how to set it up on a machine with no
Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Yandex Disk. This only runs from the moment it
opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.
This is on http://127.0.0.1:53682/ and this it may require you to
unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use rclone like this,

See top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync /home/local/directory to the remote path, deleting any excess files
in the path.

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:directory

Yandex paths may be as deep as required, eg
remote:directory/subdirectory.

Modified time

Modified times are supported and are stored accurate to 1 ns in custom
metadata called rclone_modified in RFC3339 with nanoseconds format.

MD5 checksums

MD5 checksums are natively supported by Yandex Disk.

Emptying Trash

If you wish to empty your trash you can use the rclone cleanup remote:
command which will permanently delete all your trashed files. This
command does not take any path arguments.

Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the rclone about remote: command
which will display your usage limit (quota) and the current usage.

Restricted filename characters

The default restricted characters set are replaced.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be used in JSON
strings.

Limitations

When uploading very large files (bigger than about 5GB) you will need to
increase the --timeout parameter. This is because Yandex pauses (perhaps
to calculate the MD5SUM for the entire file) before returning
confirmation that the file has been uploaded. The default handling of
timeouts in rclone is to assume a 5 minute pause is an error and close
the connection - you’ll see net/http: timeout awaiting response headers
errors in the logs if this is happening. Setting the timeout to twice
the max size of file in GB should be enough, so if you want to upload a
30GB file set a timeout of 2 * 30 = 60m, that is --timeout 60m.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to yandex (Yandex Disk).

–yandex-client-id

Yandex Client Id Leave blank normally.

-   Config: client_id
-   Env Var: RCLONE_YANDEX_CLIENT_ID
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

–yandex-client-secret

Yandex Client Secret Leave blank normally.

-   Config: client_secret
-   Env Var: RCLONE_YANDEX_CLIENT_SECRET
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to yandex (Yandex Disk).

–yandex-unlink

Remove existing public link to file/folder with link command rather than
creating. Default is false, meaning link command will create or retrieve
public link.

-   Config: unlink
-   Env Var: RCLONE_YANDEX_UNLINK
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false


Local Filesystem

Local paths are specified as normal filesystem paths, eg
/path/to/wherever, so

    rclone sync /home/source /tmp/destination

Will sync /home/source to /tmp/destination

These can be configured into the config file for consistencies sake, but
it is probably easier not to.

Modified time

Rclone reads and writes the modified time using an accuracy determined
by the OS. Typically this is 1ns on Linux, 10 ns on Windows and 1 Second
on OS X.

Filenames

Filenames should be encoded in UTF-8 on disk. This is the normal case
for Windows and OS X.

There is a bit more uncertainty in the Linux world, but new
distributions will have UTF-8 encoded files names. If you are using an
old Linux filesystem with non UTF-8 file names (eg latin1) then you can
use the convmv tool to convert the filesystem to UTF-8. This tool is
available in most distributions’ package managers.

If an invalid (non-UTF8) filename is read, the invalid characters will
be replaced with a quoted representation of the invalid bytes. The name
gro\xdf will be transferred as gro‛DF. rclone will emit a debug message
in this case (use -v to see), eg

    Local file system at .: Replacing invalid UTF-8 characters in "gro\xdf"

Restricted characters

On non Windows platforms the following characters are replaced when
handling file names.

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  NUL          0x00         ␀
  /            0x2F        ／

When running on Windows the following characters are replaced. This list
is based on the Windows file naming conventions.

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  NUL          0x00         ␀

  \            0x5C        ＼
  |            0x7C        ｜

File names on Windows can also not end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are last character in the name:

  Character    Value   Replacement
  ----------- ------- -------------
  SP           0x20         ␠
  .            0x2E        ．

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be replaced, as they can’t be converted to
UTF-16.

Long paths on Windows

Rclone handles long paths automatically, by converting all paths to long
UNC paths which allows paths up to 32,767 characters.

This is why you will see that your paths, for instance c:\files is
converted to the UNC path \\?\c:\files in the output, and \\server\share
is converted to \\?\UNC\server\share.

However, in rare cases this may cause problems with buggy file system
drivers like EncFS. To disable UNC conversion globally, add this to your
.rclone.conf file:

    [local]
    nounc = true

If you want to selectively disable UNC, you can add it to a separate
entry like this:

    [nounc]
    type = local
    nounc = true

And use rclone like this:

rclone copy c:\src nounc:z:\dst

This will use UNC paths on c:\src but not on z:\dst. Of course this will
cause problems if the absolute path length of a file exceeds 258
characters on z, so only use this option if you have to.

Symlinks / Junction points

Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave
like symlinks under Windows).

If you supply --copy-links or -L then rclone will follow the symlink and
copy the pointed to file or directory. Note that this flag is
incompatible with -links / -l.

This flag applies to all commands.

For example, supposing you have a directory structure like this

    $ tree /tmp/a
    /tmp/a
    ├── b -> ../b
    ├── expected -> ../expected
    ├── one
    └── two
        └── three

Then you can see the difference with and without the flag like this

    $ rclone ls /tmp/a
            6 one
            6 two/three

and

    $ rclone -L ls /tmp/a
         4174 expected
            6 one
            6 two/three
            6 b/two
            6 b/one

–links, -l

Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave
like symlinks under Windows).

If you supply this flag then rclone will copy symbolic links from the
local storage, and store them as text files, with a ‘.rclonelink’ suffix
in the remote storage.

The text file will contain the target of the symbolic link (see
example).

This flag applies to all commands.

For example, supposing you have a directory structure like this

    $ tree /tmp/a
    /tmp/a
    ├── file1 -> ./file4
    └── file2 -> /home/user/file3

Copying the entire directory with ‘-l’

    $ rclone copyto -l /tmp/a/file1 remote:/tmp/a/

The remote files are created with a ‘.rclonelink’ suffix

    $ rclone ls remote:/tmp/a
           5 file1.rclonelink
          14 file2.rclonelink

The remote files will contain the target of the symbolic links

    $ rclone cat remote:/tmp/a/file1.rclonelink
    ./file4

    $ rclone cat remote:/tmp/a/file2.rclonelink
    /home/user/file3

Copying them back with ‘-l’

    $ rclone copyto -l remote:/tmp/a/ /tmp/b/

    $ tree /tmp/b
    /tmp/b
    ├── file1 -> ./file4
    └── file2 -> /home/user/file3

However, if copied back without ‘-l’

    $ rclone copyto remote:/tmp/a/ /tmp/b/

    $ tree /tmp/b
    /tmp/b
    ├── file1.rclonelink
    └── file2.rclonelink

Note that this flag is incompatible with -copy-links / -L.

Restricting filesystems with –one-file-system

Normally rclone will recurse through filesystems as mounted.

However if you set --one-file-system or -x this tells rclone to stay in
the filesystem specified by the root and not to recurse into different
file systems.

For example if you have a directory hierarchy like this

    root
    ├── disk1     - disk1 mounted on the root
    │   └── file3 - stored on disk1
    ├── disk2     - disk2 mounted on the root
    │   └── file4 - stored on disk12
    ├── file1     - stored on the root disk
    └── file2     - stored on the root disk

Using rclone --one-file-system copy root remote: will only copy file1
and file2. Eg

    $ rclone -q --one-file-system ls root
            0 file1
            0 file2

    $ rclone -q ls root
            0 disk1/file3
            0 disk2/file4
            0 file1
            0 file2

NB Rclone (like most unix tools such as du, rsync and tar) treats a bind
mount to the same device as being on the same filesystem.

NB This flag is only available on Unix based systems. On systems where
it isn’t supported (eg Windows) it will be ignored.

Standard Options

Here are the standard options specific to local (Local Disk).

–local-nounc

Disable UNC (long path names) conversion on Windows

-   Config: nounc
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_NOUNC
-   Type: string
-   Default: ""
-   Examples:
    -   “true”
        -   Disables long file names

Advanced Options

Here are the advanced options specific to local (Local Disk).

–copy-links / -L

Follow symlinks and copy the pointed to item.

-   Config: copy_links
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_COPY_LINKS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–links / -l

Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a ‘.rclonelink’ extension

-   Config: links
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_LINKS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–skip-links

Don’t warn about skipped symlinks. This flag disables warning messages
on skipped symlinks or junction points, as you explicitly acknowledge
that they should be skipped.

-   Config: skip_links
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_SKIP_LINKS
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–local-no-unicode-normalization

Don’t apply unicode normalization to paths and filenames (Deprecated)

This flag is deprecated now. Rclone no longer normalizes unicode file
names, but it compares them with unicode normalization in the sync
routine instead.

-   Config: no_unicode_normalization
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_UNICODE_NORMALIZATION
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–local-no-check-updated

Don’t check to see if the files change during upload

Normally rclone checks the size and modification time of files as they
are being uploaded and aborts with a message which starts “can’t copy -
source file is being updated” if the file changes during upload.

However on some file systems this modification time check may fail (eg
Glusterfs #2206) so this check can be disabled with this flag.

-   Config: no_check_updated
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_CHECK_UPDATED
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–one-file-system / -x

Don’t cross filesystem boundaries (unix/macOS only).

-   Config: one_file_system
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_ONE_FILE_SYSTEM
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–local-case-sensitive

Force the filesystem to report itself as case sensitive.

Normally the local backend declares itself as case insensitive on
Windows/macOS and case sensitive for everything else. Use this flag to
override the default choice.

-   Config: case_sensitive
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_CASE_SENSITIVE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

–local-case-insensitive

Force the filesystem to report itself as case insensitive

Normally the local backend declares itself as case insensitive on
Windows/macOS and case sensitive for everything else. Use this flag to
override the default choice.

-   Config: case_insensitive
-   Env Var: RCLONE_LOCAL_CASE_INSENSITIVE
-   Type: bool
-   Default: false

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS


Limitations

Directory timestamps aren’t preserved

Rclone doesn’t currently preserve the timestamps of directories. This is
because rclone only really considers objects when syncing.

Rclone struggles with millions of files in a directory

Currently rclone loads each directory entirely into memory before using
it. Since each Rclone object takes 0.5k-1k of memory this can take a
very long time and use an extremely large amount of memory.

Millions of files in a directory tend caused by software writing cloud
storage (eg S3 buckets).

Bucket based remotes and folders

Bucket based remotes (eg S3/GCS/Swift/B2) do not have a concept of
directories. Rclone therefore cannot create directories in them which
means that empty directories on a bucket based remote will tend to
disappear.

Some software creates empty keys ending in / as directory markers.
Rclone doesn’t do this as it potentially creates more objects and costs
more. It may do in future (probably with a flag).

Frequently Asked Questions

Do all cloud storage systems support all rclone commands

Yes they do. All the rclone commands (eg sync, copy etc) will work on
all the remote storage systems.

Can I copy the config from one machine to another

Sure! Rclone stores all of its config in a single file. If you want to
find this file, run rclone config file which will tell you where it is.

See the remote setup docs for more info.

How do I configure rclone on a remote / headless box with no browser?

This has now been documented in its own remote setup page.

Can rclone sync directly from drive to s3

Rclone can sync between two remote cloud storage systems just fine.

Note that it effectively downloads the file and uploads it again, so the
node running rclone would need to have lots of bandwidth.

The syncs would be incremental (on a file by file basis).

Eg

    rclone sync drive:Folder s3:bucket

Using rclone from multiple locations at the same time

You can use rclone from multiple places at the same time if you choose
different subdirectory for the output, eg

    Server A> rclone sync /tmp/whatever remote:ServerA
    Server B> rclone sync /tmp/whatever remote:ServerB

If you sync to the same directory then you should use rclone copy
otherwise the two rclones may delete each others files, eg

    Server A> rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup
    Server B> rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup

The file names you upload from Server A and Server B should be different
in this case, otherwise some file systems (eg Drive) may make
duplicates.

Why doesn’t rclone support partial transfers / binary diffs like rsync?

Rclone stores each file you transfer as a native object on the remote
cloud storage system. This means that you can see the files you upload
as expected using alternative access methods (eg using the Google Drive
web interface). There is a 1:1 mapping between files on your hard disk
and objects created in the cloud storage system.

Cloud storage systems (at least none I’ve come across yet) don’t support
partially uploading an object. You can’t take an existing object, and
change some bytes in the middle of it.

It would be possible to make a sync system which stored binary diffs
instead of whole objects like rclone does, but that would break the 1:1
mapping of files on your hard disk to objects in the remote cloud
storage system.

All the cloud storage systems support partial downloads of content, so
it would be possible to make partial downloads work. However to make
this work efficiently this would require storing a significant amount of
metadata, which breaks the desired 1:1 mapping of files to objects.

Can rclone do bi-directional sync?

No, not at present. rclone only does uni-directional sync from A -> B.
It may do in the future though since it has all the primitives - it just
requires writing the algorithm to do it.

Can I use rclone with an HTTP proxy?

Yes. rclone will follow the standard environment variables for proxies,
similar to cURL and other programs.

In general the variables are called http_proxy (for services reached
over http) and https_proxy (for services reached over https). Most
public services will be using https, but you may wish to set both.

The content of the variable is protocol://server:port. The protocol
value is the one used to talk to the proxy server, itself, and is
commonly either http or socks5.

Slightly annoyingly, there is no _standard_ for the name; some
applications may use http_proxy but another one HTTP_PROXY. The Go
libraries used by rclone will try both variations, but you may wish to
set all possibilities. So, on Linux, you may end up with code similar to

    export http_proxy=http://proxyserver:12345
    export https_proxy=$http_proxy
    export HTTP_PROXY=$http_proxy
    export HTTPS_PROXY=$http_proxy

The NO_PROXY allows you to disable the proxy for specific hosts. Hosts
must be comma separated, and can contain domains or parts. For instance
“foo.com” also matches “bar.foo.com”.

e.g.

    export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.0/8,my.host.name
    export NO_PROXY=$no_proxy

Note that the ftp backend does not support ftp_proxy yet.

Rclone gives x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided error

This means that rclone can’t file the SSL root certificates. Likely you
are running rclone on a NAS with a cut-down Linux OS, or possibly on
Solaris.

Rclone (via the Go runtime) tries to load the root certificates from
these places on Linux.

    "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt", // Debian/Ubuntu/Gentoo etc.
    "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt",   // Fedora/RHEL
    "/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem",             // OpenSUSE
    "/etc/pki/tls/cacert.pem",            // OpenELEC

So doing something like this should fix the problem. It also sets the
time which is important for SSL to work properly.

    mkdir -p /etc/ssl/certs/
    curl -o /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca-bundle/master/ca-bundle.crt
    ntpclient -s -h pool.ntp.org

The two environment variables SSL_CERT_FILE and SSL_CERT_DIR, mentioned
in the x509 package, provide an additional way to provide the SSL root
certificates.

Note that you may need to add the --insecure option to the curl command
line if it doesn’t work without.

    curl --insecure -o /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca-bundle/master/ca-bundle.crt

Rclone gives Failed to load config file: function not implemented error

Likely this means that you are running rclone on Linux version not
supported by the go runtime, ie earlier than version 2.6.23.

See the system requirements section in the go install docs for full
details.

All my uploaded docx/xlsx/pptx files appear as archive/zip

This is caused by uploading these files from a Windows computer which
hasn’t got the Microsoft Office suite installed. The easiest way to fix
is to install the Word viewer and the Microsoft Office Compatibility
Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 and later versions’ file
formats

tcp lookup some.domain.com no such host

This happens when rclone cannot resolve a domain. Please check that your
DNS setup is generally working, e.g.

    # both should print a long list of possible IP addresses
    dig www.googleapis.com          # resolve using your default DNS
    dig www.googleapis.com @8.8.8.8 # resolve with Google's DNS server

If you are using systemd-resolved (default on Arch Linux), ensure it is
at version 233 or higher. Previous releases contain a bug which causes
not all domains to be resolved properly.

Additionally with the GODEBUG=netdns= environment variable the Go
resolver decision can be influenced. This also allows to resolve certain
issues with DNS resolution. See the name resolution section in the go
docs.

The total size reported in the stats for a sync is wrong and keeps changing

It is likely you have more than 10,000 files that need to be synced. By
default rclone only gets 10,000 files ahead in a sync so as not to use
up too much memory. You can change this default with the –max-backlog
flag.

Rclone is using too much memory or appears to have a memory leak

Rclone is written in Go which uses a garbage collector. The default
settings for the garbage collector mean that it runs when the heap size
has doubled.

However it is possible to tune the garbage collector to use less memory
by setting GOGC to a lower value, say export GOGC=20. This will make the
garbage collector work harder, reducing memory size at the expense of
CPU usage.

The most common cause of rclone using lots of memory is a single
directory with thousands or millions of files in. Rclone has to load
this entirely into memory as rclone objects. Each rclone object takes
0.5k-1k of memory.

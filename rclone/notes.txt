Change lsd command so it doesn't show -1
  * Make sure all Fses show -1 for objects Zero for dates, etc.
  * Make test?

Put the TestRemote names into the Fs description
Make fs/test_all.go use the TestRemote name automatically

Get rid of Storable?

Todo
  * FIXME: More -dry-run checks for object transfer
  * Might be quicker to check md5sums first? for swift <-> swift certainly, and maybe for small files
  * FIXME Make NewFs to return err.IsAnObject so can put the LimitedFs
    creation in common code? Or try for as much as possible?
  * FIXME Account all the transactions (ls, etc.) using a different
    Roundtripper wrapper which wraps the transactions?

Ideas
  * could do encryption - put IV into metadata?
  * optimise remote copy container to another container using remote
    copy if local is same as remote - use an optional Copier interface
  * support
      * sftp
      * scp
      * rsync over ssh
  * control times sync (which is slow with some remotes) with -a --archive flag?
  * Copy a glob pattern - could do with LimitedFs

Make an encryption layer.

This would layer over the source FS to
    * decrypt all gets
    * encrypt all puts
    * encrypt file names in list
    * decrypt them in list

Would like to be able to see unencrypted file names in remote though? How?  Or is that two encryption layers..?

Bugs
  * Non verbose - not sure number transferred got counted up? CHECK
  * When doing copy it recurses the whole of the destination FS which isn't necessary
